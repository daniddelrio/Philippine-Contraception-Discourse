_____________________

Hi! This will be a very lengthy post containing a brief overview on what this contraceptive method is, and then focusing on the procedure + post-insertion. I'm doing this because in the months I've researched about a contraceptive implant in the PH, I have come up with very little information (even on this sub!) and I want to give you guys an insight into another option. At the end of this post, I have a few links and a tl;dr!

I will say this beforehand though: *If you have a deathly fear of injections, this might not be the method for you.*

**What is a contraceptive implant?**

**The contraceptive implant is a stick they insert in your arm**, between your skin and muscle, that prevents pregnancies **99.05% of the time** for both normal *and* perfect use. It's pretty hard to fuck something up when it's already inside your skin. That means less than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant in a year. The only way it fails is that if it breaks, you have sex following the 7 days after insertion, or you were already pregnant prior insertion. You have to replace this **every 3 years**. 

Some things about the implant:

1. It does not prevent against STDs. Use a condom for that.
2. It does not act as an emergency contraceptive unlike IUDs. If you're pregnant, they won't put this in you.
3. Yes, it has side-effects, as is with every hormonal contraceptive. Common ones are lighter to no periods at all, *LOTS* of periods, random spotting, acne, and weight gain. Make sure you've thoroughly researched the side-effects. What one person experienced may not be what you will experience. Your experience can be better or worse than others' because **each body is different and will react differently to the implant**.

You can also Google for more info.

**Procedure**

So I got my contraceptive implant, *Implanon* (an American brand), last June 27. I got it inserted in the Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Ofelia St., Brgy. Bahay Toro, Project 8, Quezon City. They have other branches as well; they have two in Tondo (Vitas, and Delpan), and others which I am not aware of. 

The contraceptive implant is **free**. Why is it free?, you ask. That's because Likhaan is an NGO that primarily focuses on women in marginalized communities. You can't exactly make poor people get contraceptives if they cost money. So yeah. From what I've read, OB-GYNEs usually charge 8-10k.

I went on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't particularly busy. There was just one person before me. The people there are nice and friendly; *super non-judgmental* especially since I'm a minor (17) and I don't exactly look marginalized. They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. 

The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

That's pretty much it! I was told to take Mefenamic Acid if the pain gets too much. Never had to take any, though. 

**AFTERNOTES + LINKS**

* The bruise could look pretty prominent on your arm. If you live with people who would not approve of this then I don't really know how to hide this from them. It's probably also important to note that you should consider wearing a cardigan or something lest you want others to think you're a domestic abuse victim.
* [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/3WUAE) containing some pics of the bruise and a few other things if you'd like to see.
* If this is your first time to get a contraceptive, I wouldn't recommend having an implant as the first method. Try Pills first, or something.
* **If you want Likhaan's phone number, feel free to shoot me a PM!** The ones lying around on the Internet are mostly outdated, lol.
* I would like to thank /r/BirthControl for info about the Implanon, mainly about experiences during and while on it! It's a pretty handy resource for all kinds of contraceptives.
* PGH's Ortoll Primary Reproductive Health Care Center also has free Implanon, I think, but they've been out of stock for God knows how long. Won't hurt to call them to check though.

If you have more questions, send me a PM or comment below ♥

**TL;DR:** The contraceptive implant is a stick thing in your arm that's 99.95% effective (as effective or even more than a tubal ligation or an IUD) which has to be replaced every 3 years and is reversible. The procedure was done in Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Proj. 8, QC and was really quick and non-invasive. 

**UPDATE 09/26/2018**: I will no longer answer questions about how to contact Likhaan and whether you can walk-in or not. They now have a Facebook Page called ""Likhaan Center for Women's Health Inc."" which has the contact information for ALL of their branches on their PINNED post. Please understand that I keep on getting repetitive PMs about this so please make use of the accessible info from their FB page.",Ryvaeus,"No questions, just wanted to thank you for posting.

I work in a clinic where we put in Implanon and IUDs. I feel like this is the general consensus to everyone who offers it on their clinic, since it is a very responsible choice.

Hi! This will be a very lengthy post containing a brief overview on what this contraceptive method is, and then focusing on the procedure + post-insertion. I'm doing this because in the months I've researched about a contraceptive implant in the PH, I have come up with very little information (even on this sub!) and I want to give you guys an insight into another option. At the end of this post, I have a few links and a tl;dr!

I will say this beforehand though: *If you have a deathly fear of injections, this might not be the method for you.*

**What is a contraceptive implant?**

**The contraceptive implant is a stick they insert in your arm**, between your skin and muscle, that prevents pregnancies **99.05% of the time** for both normal *and* perfect use. It's pretty hard to fuck something up when it's already inside your skin. That means less than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant in a year. The only way it fails is that if it breaks, you have sex following the 7 days after insertion, or you were already pregnant prior insertion. You have to replace this **every 3 years**. 

Some things about the implant:

1. It does not prevent against STDs. Use a condom for that.
2. It does not act as an emergency contraceptive unlike IUDs. If you're pregnant, they won't put this in you.
3. Yes, it has side-effects, as is with every hormonal contraceptive. Common ones are lighter to no periods at all, *LOTS* of periods, random spotting, acne, and weight gain. Make sure you've thoroughly researched the side-effects. What one person experienced may not be what you will experience. Your experience can be better or worse than others' because **each body is different and will react differently to the implant**.

You can also Google for more info.

**Procedure**

So I got my contraceptive implant, *Implanon* (an American brand), last June 27. I got it inserted in the Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Ofelia St., Brgy. Bahay Toro, Project 8, Quezon City. They have other branches as well; they have two in Tondo (Vitas, and Delpan), and others which I am not aware of. 

The contraceptive implant is **free**. Why is it free?, you ask. That's because Likhaan is an NGO that primarily focuses on women in marginalized communities. You can't exactly make poor people get contraceptives if they cost money. So yeah. From what I've read, OB-GYNEs usually charge 8-10k.

I went on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't particularly busy. There was just one person before me. The people there are nice and friendly; *super non-judgmental* especially since I'm a minor (17) and I don't exactly look marginalized. They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. 

The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

That's pretty much it! I was told to take Mefenamic Acid if the pain gets too much. Never had to take any, though. 

**AFTERNOTES + LINKS**

* The bruise could look pretty prominent on your arm. If you live with people who would not approve of this then I don't really know how to hide this from them. It's probably also important to note that you should consider wearing a cardigan or something lest you want others to think you're a domestic abuse victim.
* [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/3WUAE) containing some pics of the bruise and a few other things if you'd like to see.
* If this is your first time to get a contraceptive, I wouldn't recommend having an implant as the first method. Try Pills first, or something.
* **If you want Likhaan's phone number, feel free to shoot me a PM!** The ones lying around on the Internet are mostly outdated, lol.
* I would like to thank /r/BirthControl for info about the Implanon, mainly about experiences during and while on it! It's a pretty handy resource for all kinds of contraceptives.
* PGH's Ortoll Primary Reproductive Health Care Center also has free Implanon, I think, but they've been out of stock for God knows how long. Won't hurt to call them to check though.

If you have more questions, send me a PM or comment below ♥

**TL;DR:** The contraceptive implant is a stick thing in your arm that's 99.95% effective (as effective or even more than a tubal ligation or an IUD) which has to be replaced every 3 years and is reversible. The procedure was done in Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Proj. 8, QC and was really quick and non-invasive. 

**UPDATE 09/26/2018**: I will no longer answer questions about how to contact Likhaan and whether you can walk-in or not. They now have a Facebook Page called ""Likhaan Center for Women's Health Inc."" which has the contact information for ALL of their branches on their PINNED post.

1. Does this have any adverse medical effects? Like, if you have allergies and you can't get this.

2. Do you need to show parental permission if you're under 18? I'm 18 but I'm asking this one for a friend.

3. Is there a way to stop the bruising? Because I sort of want to get this but my parents wouldn't look too kindly on me getting this.

Hi! This will be a very lengthy post containing a brief overview on what this contraceptive method is, and then focusing on the procedure + post-insertion. I'm doing this because in the months I've researched about a contraceptive implant in the PH, I have come up with very little information (even on this sub!) and I want to give you guys an insight into another option. At the end of this post, I have a few links and a tl;dr!

I will say this beforehand though: *If you have a deathly fear of injections, this might not be the method for you.*

**What is a contraceptive implant?**

**The contraceptive implant is a stick they insert in your arm**, between your skin and muscle, that prevents pregnancies **99.05% of the time** for both normal *and* perfect use. It's pretty hard to fuck something up when it's already inside your skin. That means less than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant in a year. The only way it fails is that if it breaks, you have sex following the 7 days after insertion, or you were already pregnant prior insertion. You have to replace this **every 3 years**. 

Some things about the implant:

1. It does not prevent against STDs. Use a condom for that.
2. It does not act as an emergency contraceptive unlike IUDs. If you're pregnant, they won't put this in you.
3. Yes, it has side-effects, as is with every hormonal contraceptive. Common ones are lighter to no periods at all, *LOTS* of periods, random spotting, acne, and weight gain. Make sure you've thoroughly researched the side-effects. What one person experienced may not be what you will experience. Your experience can be better or worse than others' because **each body is different and will react differently to the implant**.

You can also Google for more info.

**Procedure**

So I got my contraceptive implant, *Implanon* (an American brand), last June 27. I got it inserted in the Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Ofelia St., Brgy. Bahay Toro, Project 8, Quezon City. They have other branches as well; they have two in Tondo (Vitas, and Delpan), and others which I am not aware of. 

The contraceptive implant is **free**. Why is it free?, you ask. That's because Likhaan is an NGO that primarily focuses on women in marginalized communities. You can't exactly make poor people get contraceptives if they cost money. So yeah. From what I've read, OB-GYNEs usually charge 8-10k.

I went on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't particularly busy. There was just one person before me. The people there are nice and friendly; *super non-judgmental* especially since I'm a minor (17) and I don't exactly look marginalized. They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. 

The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

That's pretty much it! I was told to take Mefenamic Acid if the pain gets too much. Never had to take any, though. 

**AFTERNOTES + LINKS**

* The bruise could look pretty prominent on your arm. If you live with people who would not approve of this then I don't really know how to hide this from them. It's probably also important to note that you should consider wearing a cardigan or something lest you want others to think you're a domestic abuse victim.
* [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/3WUAE) containing some pics of the bruise and a few other things if you'd like to see.
* If this is your first time to get a contraceptive, I wouldn't recommend having an implant as the first method. Try Pills first, or something.
* **If you want Likhaan's phone number, feel free to shoot me a PM!** The ones lying around on the Internet are mostly outdated, lol.
* I would like to thank /r/BirthControl for info about the Implanon, mainly about experiences during and while on it! It's a pretty handy resource for all kinds of contraceptives.
* PGH's Ortoll Primary Reproductive Health Care Center also has free Implanon, I think, but they've been out of stock for God knows how long. Won't hurt to call them to check though.

If you have more questions, send me a PM or comment below ♥

**TL;DR:** The contraceptive implant is a stick thing in your arm that's 99.95% effective (as effective or even more than a tubal ligation or an IUD) which has to be replaced every 3 years and is reversible. The procedure was done in Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Proj. 8, QC and was really quick and non-invasive. 

**UPDATE 09/26/2018**: I will no longer answer questions about how to contact Likhaan and whether you can walk-in or not. They now have a Facebook Page called ""Likhaan Center for Women's Health Inc."" which has the contact information for ALL of their branches on their PINNED post. Please understand that I keep on getting repetitive PMs about this so please make use of the accessible info from their FB page.",hellosunmaid,"Hi again OP! Wanted to say kudos to you for being responsible about your body at a young age. I like to think I was just as responsible at that age but probably not. Haha! But I'm here and childless so I'm still doing something right!

Your post also reminded me that I'd been planning to get a long-acting method for a while now but I'd been putting it off for one reason or another. So I dropped by the nearest provider that I knew about and inquired.

I was wondering, were you given information regarding the cost of having the implant removed at the end of the 3 year cycle? Will the same NGO also remove it for free?

I'm wondering because I've heard stories of financially disadvantaged people who availed of free contraceptive implants, in order to avoid pregnancy. But then when the 3 year period arrives, they have no money for the procedure to remove the implant, since it appears to involve minor surgery. And then they realize that they don't know where to turn to for free removal of the implant.

The end result being that they end up leaving the implant in their bodies beyond the end-of-life of the contraceptive. This could later pose problems for them since the implant will not dissolve or be absorbed on its own, and requires removal.",0,t3_4r2tl4,2,r/Philippines,4,858,questioning

Hi! This will be a very lengthy post containing a brief overview on what this contraceptive method is, and then focusing on the procedure + post-insertion. I'm doing this because in the months I've researched about a contraceptive implant in the PH, I have come up with very little information (even on this sub!) and I want to give you guys an insight into another option. At the end of this post, I have a few links and a tl;dr!

I will say this beforehand though: *If you have a deathly fear of injections, this might not be the method for you.*

**What is a contraceptive implant?**

**The contraceptive implant is a stick they insert in your arm**, between your skin and muscle, that prevents pregnancies **99.05% of the time** for both normal *and* perfect use. It's pretty hard to fuck something up when it's already inside your skin. That means less than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant in a year. The only way it fails is that if it breaks, you have sex following the 7 days after insertion, or you were already pregnant prior insertion. You have to replace this **every 3 years**. 

Some things about the implant:

1. It does not prevent against STDs. Use a condom for that.
2. It does not act as an emergency contraceptive unlike IUDs. If you're pregnant, they won't put this in you.
3. Yes, it has side-effects, as is with every hormonal contraceptive. Common ones are lighter to no periods at all, *LOTS* of periods, random spotting, acne, and weight gain. Make sure you've thoroughly researched the side-effects. What one person experienced may not be what you will experience. Your experience can be better or worse than others' because **each body is different and will react differently to the implant**.

You can also Google for more info.

**Procedure**

So I got my contraceptive implant, *Implanon* (an American brand), last June 27. I got it inserted in the Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Ofelia St., Brgy. Bahay Toro, Project 8, Quezon City. They have other branches as well; they have two in Tondo (Vitas, and Delpan), and others which I am not aware of. 

The contraceptive implant is **free**. Why is it free?, you ask. That's because Likhaan is an NGO that primarily focuses on women in marginalized communities. You can't exactly make poor people get contraceptives if they cost money. So yeah. From what I've read, OB-GYNEs usually charge 8-10k.

I went on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't particularly busy. There was just one person before me. The people there are nice and friendly; *super non-judgmental* especially since I'm a minor (17) and I don't exactly look marginalized. They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. 

The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

That's pretty much it! I was told to take Mefenamic Acid if the pain gets too much. Never had to take any, though. 

**AFTERNOTES + LINKS**

* The bruise could look pretty prominent on your arm. If you live with people who would not approve of this then I don't really know how to hide this from them. It's probably also important to note that you should consider wearing a cardigan or something lest you want others to think you're a domestic abuse victim.
* [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/3WUAE) containing some pics of the bruise and a few other things if you'd like to see.
* If this is your first time to get a contraceptive, I wouldn't recommend having an implant as the first method. Try Pills first, or something.
* **If you want Likhaan's phone number, feel free to shoot me a PM!** The ones lying around on the Internet are mostly outdated, lol.
* I would like to thank /r/BirthControl for info about the Implanon, mainly about experiences during and while on it! It's a pretty handy resource for all kinds of contraceptives.

**TL;DR:** The contraceptive implant is a stick thing in your arm that's 99.95% effective (as effective or even more than a tubal ligation or an IUD) which has to be replaced every 3 years and is reversible. The procedure was done in Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Proj. 8, QC and was really quick and non-invasive.

Hi! This will be a very lengthy post containing a brief overview on what this contraceptive method is, and then focusing on the procedure + post-insertion. I'm doing this because in the months I've researched about a contraceptive implant in the PH, I have come up with very little information (even on this sub!) and I want to give you guys an insight into another option. At the end of this post, I have a few links and a tl;dr!

I will say this beforehand though: *If you have a deathly fear of injections, this might not be the method for you.*

**What is a contraceptive implant?**

**The contraceptive implant is a stick they insert in your arm**, between your skin and muscle, that prevents pregnancies **99.05% of the time** for both normal *and* perfect use. It's pretty hard to fuck something up when it's already inside your skin. That means less than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant in a year. The only way it fails is that if it breaks, you have sex following the 7 days after insertion, or you were already pregnant prior insertion. You have to replace this **every 3 years**. 

Some things about the implant:

1. It does not prevent against STDs. Use a condom for that.
2. It does not act as an emergency contraceptive unlike IUDs. If you're pregnant, they won't put this in you.
3. Yes, it has side-effects, as is with every hormonal contraceptive. Common ones are lighter to no periods at all, *LOTS* of periods, random spotting, acne, and weight gain. Make sure you've thoroughly researched the side-effects. What one person experienced may not be what you will experience. Your experience can be better or worse than others' because **each body is different and will react differently to the implant**.

You can also Google for more info.

**Procedure**

So I got my contraceptive implant, *Implanon* (an American brand), last June 27. I got it inserted in the Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Ofelia St., Brgy. Bahay Toro, Project 8, Quezon City. They have other branches as well; they have two in Tondo (Vitas, and Delpan), and others which I am not aware of. 

The contraceptive implant is **free**. Why is it free?, you ask. That's because Likhaan is an NGO that primarily focuses on women in marginalized communities. You can't exactly make poor people get contraceptives if they cost money. So yeah. From what I've read, OB-GYNEs usually charge 8-10k.

I went on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't particularly busy. There was just one person before me. The people there are nice and friendly; *super non-judgmental* especially since I'm a minor (17) and I don't exactly look marginalized. They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. 

The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

That's pretty much it! I was told to take Mefenamic Acid if the pain gets too much. Never had to take any, though. 

**AFTERNOTES + LINKS**

* The bruise could look pretty prominent on your arm. If you live with people who would not approve of this then I don't really know how to hide this from them. It's probably also important to note that you should consider wearing a cardigan or something lest you want others to think you're a domestic abuse victim.
* [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/3WUAE) containing some pics of the bruise and a few other things if you'd like to see.
* If this is your first time to get a contraceptive, I wouldn't recommend having an implant as the first method. Try Pills first, or something.
* **If you want Likhaan's phone number, feel free to shoot me a PM!** The ones lying around on the Internet are mostly outdated, lol.
* I would like to thank /r/BirthControl for info about the Implanon, mainly about experiences during and while on it! It's a pretty handy resource for all kinds of contraceptives.
* PGH's Ortoll Primary Reproductive Health Care Center also has free Implanon, I think, but they've been out of stock for God knows how long. Won't hurt to call them to check though.

Hi! This will be a very lengthy post containing a brief overview on what this contraceptive method is, and then focusing on the procedure + post-insertion. I'm doing this because in the months I've researched about a contraceptive implant in the PH, I have come up with very little information (even on this sub!) and I want to give you guys an insight into another option. At the end of this post, I have a few links and a tl;dr!

I will say this beforehand though: *If you have a deathly fear of injections, this might not be the method for you.*

**What is a contraceptive implant?**

**The contraceptive implant is a stick they insert in your arm**, between your skin and muscle, that prevents pregnancies **99.05% of the time** for both normal *and* perfect use. It's pretty hard to fuck something up when it's already inside your skin. That means less than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant in a year. The only way it fails is that if it breaks, you have sex following the 7 days after insertion, or you were already pregnant prior insertion. You have to replace this **every 3 years**. 

Some things about the implant:

1. It does not prevent against STDs. Use a condom for that.
2. It does not act as an emergency contraceptive unlike IUDs. If you're pregnant, they won't put this in you.
3. Yes, it has side-effects, as is with every hormonal contraceptive. Common ones are lighter to no periods at all, *LOTS* of periods, random spotting, acne, and weight gain. Make sure you've thoroughly researched the side-effects. What one person experienced may not be what you will experience. Your experience can be better or worse than others' because **each body is different and will react differently to the implant**.

You can also Google for more info.

**Procedure**

So I got my contraceptive implant, *Implanon* (an American brand), last June 27. I got it inserted in the Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Ofelia St., Brgy. Bahay Toro, Project 8, Quezon City. They have other branches as well; they have two in Tondo (Vitas, and Delpan), and others which I am not aware of. 

The contraceptive implant is **free**. Why is it free?, you ask. That's because Likhaan is an NGO that primarily focuses on women in marginalized communities. You can't exactly make poor people get contraceptives if they cost money. So yeah. From what I've read, OB-GYNEs usually charge 8-10k.

I went on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't particularly busy. There was just one person before me. The people there are nice and friendly; *super non-judgmental* especially since I'm a minor (17) and I don't exactly look marginalized. They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. 

The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

That's pretty much it! I was told to take Mefenamic Acid if the pain gets too much. Never had to take any, though. 

**AFTERNOTES + LINKS**

* The bruise could look pretty prominent on your arm. If you live with people who would not approve of this then I don't really know how to hide this from them. It's probably also important to note that you should consider wearing a cardigan or something lest you want others to think you're a domestic abuse victim.
* [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/3WUAE) containing some pics of the bruise and a few other things if you'd like to see.
* If this is your first time to get a contraceptive, I wouldn't recommend having an implant as the first method. Try Pills first, or something.
* **If you want Likhaan's phone number, feel free to shoot me a PM!** The ones lying around on the Internet are mostly outdated, lol.
* I would like to thank /r/BirthControl for info about the Implanon, mainly about experiences during and while on it! It's a pretty handy resource for all kinds of contraceptives.
* PGH's Ortoll Primary Reproductive Health Care Center also has free Implanon, I think, but they've been out of stock for God knows how long. Won't hurt to call them to check though.

If you have more questions, send me a PM or comment below ♥

**TL;DR:** The contraceptive implant is a stick thing in your arm that's 99.95% effective (as effective or even more than a tubal ligation or an IUD) which has to be replaced every 3 years and is reversible.

The downside: mood swings, headaches - BUT, it was only terrible when I started, now it's manageable, but there are sometime I get a bad migraine, but this is very rare.

However, there have been some reports in America/Europe that Yaz causes blood clots. But so far, it's only been report in women who smoke/women whose families tend to get blood clots.

Hi! This will be a very lengthy post containing a brief overview on what this contraceptive method is, and then focusing on the procedure + post-insertion. I'm doing this because in the months I've researched about a contraceptive implant in the PH, I have come up with very little information (even on this sub!) and I want to give you guys an insight into another option. At the end of this post, I have a few links and a tl;dr!

I will say this beforehand though: *If you have a deathly fear of injections, this might not be the method for you.*

**What is a contraceptive implant?**

**The contraceptive implant is a stick they insert in your arm**, between your skin and muscle, that prevents pregnancies **99.05% of the time** for both normal *and* perfect use. It's pretty hard to fuck something up when it's already inside your skin. That means less than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant in a year. The only way it fails is that if it breaks, you have sex following the 7 days after insertion, or you were already pregnant prior insertion. You have to replace this **every 3 years**. 

Some things about the implant:

1. It does not prevent against STDs. Use a condom for that.
2. It does not act as an emergency contraceptive unlike IUDs. If you're pregnant, they won't put this in you.
3. Yes, it has side-effects, as is with every hormonal contraceptive. Common ones are lighter to no periods at all, *LOTS* of periods, random spotting, acne, and weight gain. Make sure you've thoroughly researched the side-effects. What one person experienced may not be what you will experience. Your experience can be better or worse than others' because **each body is different and will react differently to the implant**.

You can also Google for more info.

**Procedure**

So I got my contraceptive implant, *Implanon* (an American brand), last June 27. I got it inserted in the Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Ofelia St., Brgy. Bahay Toro, Project 8, Quezon City. They have other branches as well; they have two in Tondo (Vitas, and Delpan), and others which I am not aware of. 

The contraceptive implant is **free**. Why is it free?, you ask. That's because Likhaan is an NGO that primarily focuses on women in marginalized communities. You can't exactly make poor people get contraceptives if they cost money. So yeah. From what I've read, OB-GYNEs usually charge 8-10k.

I went on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't particularly busy. There was just one person before me. The people there are nice and friendly; *super non-judgmental* especially since I'm a minor (17) and I don't exactly look marginalized. They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. 

The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

That's pretty much it! I was told to take Mefenamic Acid if the pain gets too much. Never had to take any, though. 

**AFTERNOTES + LINKS**

* The bruise could look pretty prominent on your arm. If you live with people who would not approve of this then I don't really know how to hide this from them. It's probably also important to note that you should consider wearing a cardigan or something lest you want others to think you're a domestic abuse victim.
* [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/3WUAE) containing some pics of the bruise and a few other things if you'd like to see.
* If this is your first time to get a contraceptive, I wouldn't recommend having an implant as the first method. Try Pills first, or something.
* **If you want Likhaan's phone number, feel free to shoot me a PM!** The ones lying around on the Internet are mostly outdated, lol.
* I would like to thank /r/BirthControl for info about the Implanon, mainly about experiences during and while on it! It's a pretty handy resource for all kinds of contraceptives.
* PGH's Ortoll Primary Reproductive Health Care Center also has free Implanon, I think, but they've been out of stock for God knows how long. Won't hurt to call them to check though.

If you have more questions, send me a PM or comment below ♥

**TL;DR:** The contraceptive implant is a stick thing in your arm that's 99.95% effective (as effective or even more than a tubal ligation or an IUD) which has to be replaced every 3 years and is reversible. The procedure was done in Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Proj. 8, QC and was really quick and non-invasive. 

**UPDATE 09/26/2018**: I will no longer answer questions about how to contact Likhaan and whether you can walk-in or not.

Hi! This will be a very lengthy post containing a brief overview on what this contraceptive method is, and then focusing on the procedure + post-insertion. I'm doing this because in the months I've researched about a contraceptive implant in the PH, I have come up with very little information (even on this sub!) and I want to give you guys an insight into another option. At the end of this post, I have a few links and a tl;dr!

I will say this beforehand though: *If you have a deathly fear of injections, this might not be the method for you.*

**What is a contraceptive implant?**

**The contraceptive implant is a stick they insert in your arm**, between your skin and muscle, that prevents pregnancies **99.05% of the time** for both normal *and* perfect use. It's pretty hard to fuck something up when it's already inside your skin. That means less than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant in a year. The only way it fails is that if it breaks, you have sex following the 7 days after insertion, or you were already pregnant prior insertion. You have to replace this **every 3 years**. 

Some things about the implant:

1. It does not prevent against STDs. Use a condom for that.
2. It does not act as an emergency contraceptive unlike IUDs. If you're pregnant, they won't put this in you.
3. Yes, it has side-effects, as is with every hormonal contraceptive. Common ones are lighter to no periods at all, *LOTS* of periods, random spotting, acne, and weight gain. Make sure you've thoroughly researched the side-effects. What one person experienced may not be what you will experience. Your experience can be better or worse than others' because **each body is different and will react differently to the implant**.

You can also Google for more info.

**Procedure**

So I got my contraceptive implant, *Implanon* (an American brand), last June 27. I got it inserted in the Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Ofelia St., Brgy. Bahay Toro, Project 8, Quezon City. They have other branches as well; they have two in Tondo (Vitas, and Delpan), and others which I am not aware of. 

The contraceptive implant is **free**. Why is it free?, you ask. That's because Likhaan is an NGO that primarily focuses on women in marginalized communities. You can't exactly make poor people get contraceptives if they cost money. So yeah. From what I've read, OB-GYNEs usually charge 8-10k.

I went on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't particularly busy. There was just one person before me. The people there are nice and friendly; *super non-judgmental* especially since I'm a minor (17) and I don't exactly look marginalized. They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. 

The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

That's pretty much it! I was told to take Mefenamic Acid if the pain gets too much. Never had to take any, though. 

**AFTERNOTES + LINKS**

* The bruise could look pretty prominent on your arm. If you live with people who would not approve of this then I don't really know how to hide this from them. It's probably also important to note that you should consider wearing a cardigan or something lest you want others to think you're a domestic abuse victim.
* [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/3WUAE) containing some pics of the bruise and a few other things if you'd like to see.

**TL;DR:** The contraceptive implant is a stick thing in your arm that's 99.95% effective (as effective or even more than a tubal ligation or an IUD) which has to be replaced every 3 years and is reversible. The procedure was done in Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Proj. 8, QC and was really quick and non-invasive. 

**UPDATE 09/26/2018**: I will no longer answer questions about how to contact Likhaan and whether you can walk-in or not.

I think it's more of if you take certain medicines that might get in the way of the implant. But please rule out the possibility of you being allergic to the stuff in it as well :)

2. Nope. 17 and just walked in.

3. Hmm, I don't think so. Before the practitioner inserted the Implanon, she remarked that I looked very ""pasain"", or prone to bruises. I think it's usually fair-skinned people or anemics. 

Also, you're welcome! :) Glad to have helped!",1,t1_d4ydgnv,3,r/Philippines,0,460,commenting

Hi! This will be a very lengthy post containing a brief overview on what this contraceptive method is, and then focusing on the procedure + post-insertion. I'm doing this because in the months I've researched about a contraceptive implant in the PH, I have come up with very little information (even on this sub!) and I want to give you guys an insight into another option. At the end of this post, I have a few links and a tl;dr!

I will say this beforehand though: *If you have a deathly fear of injections, this might not be the method for you.*

**What is a contraceptive implant?**

**The contraceptive implant is a stick they insert in your arm**, between your skin and muscle, that prevents pregnancies **99.05% of the time** for both normal *and* perfect use. It's pretty hard to fuck something up when it's already inside your skin. That means less than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant in a year. The only way it fails is that if it breaks, you have sex following the 7 days after insertion, or you were already pregnant prior insertion. You have to replace this **every 3 years**. 

Some things about the implant:

1. It does not prevent against STDs. Use a condom for that.
2. It does not act as an emergency contraceptive unlike IUDs. If you're pregnant, they won't put this in you.
3. Yes, it has side-effects, as is with every hormonal contraceptive. Common ones are lighter to no periods at all, *LOTS* of periods, random spotting, acne, and weight gain. Make sure you've thoroughly researched the side-effects. What one person experienced may not be what you will experience. Your experience can be better or worse than others' because **each body is different and will react differently to the implant**.

You can also Google for more info.

**Procedure**

So I got my contraceptive implant, *Implanon* (an American brand), last June 27. I got it inserted in the Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Ofelia St., Brgy. Bahay Toro, Project 8, Quezon City. They have other branches as well; they have two in Tondo (Vitas, and Delpan), and others which I am not aware of. 

The contraceptive implant is **free**. Why is it free?, you ask. That's because Likhaan is an NGO that primarily focuses on women in marginalized communities. You can't exactly make poor people get contraceptives if they cost money. So yeah. From what I've read, OB-GYNEs usually charge 8-10k.

I went on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't particularly busy. There was just one person before me. The people there are nice and friendly; *super non-judgmental* especially since I'm a minor (17) and I don't exactly look marginalized. They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. 

The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

That's pretty much it! I was told to take Mefenamic Acid if the pain gets too much. Never had to take any, though. 

**AFTERNOTES + LINKS**

* The bruise could look pretty prominent on your arm. If you live with people who would not approve of this then I don't really know how to hide this from them. It's probably also important to note that you should consider wearing a cardigan or something lest you want others to think you're a domestic abuse victim.
* [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/3WUAE) containing some pics of the bruise and a few other things if you'd like to see.
* If this is your first time to get a contraceptive, I wouldn't recommend having an implant as the first method. Try Pills first, or something.

Hi, I place these.


They are placed in the arm due to safety and hiding it away. 
The implant is placed in a small valley that is just between your biceps and triceps my muscles. You can feel this space on you right now. 

That area is the inside of the arm. It is out of the way, it is hidden. If you do get a scar ( the implant is placed through hole about 2mm in size) it's hidden. 

It's a safe place versus many others. 

I'm not sure why the OP had bleeding. Usually you might get a single drop of blood if done right.

The rest is very accurate. Numbed up (same like a dentist , stings a little then skin is asleep in 3-5 seconds) then the implant is placed. 

If done by an experienced person, I'd say the whole thing takes less than 10 minute and most of that is cleaning and numbing the skin. Takes about 10 seconds or less to place the actual implant part.


Implant is match stick size, flexible, and can be replaced in 3 years. You can feel it if you go poking, but otherwise will not feel it or are it, even with arms up in the air showing that part of the arm.

Want to get pregnant? Just go get it removed.",1,t1_d4xvenh,6,r/Philippines,8,1217,commenting

It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

That's pretty much it! I was told to take Mefenamic Acid if the pain gets too much. Never had to take any, though.

**TL;DR:** The contraceptive implant is a stick thing in your arm that's 99.95% effective (as effective or even more than a tubal ligation or an IUD) which has to be replaced every 3 years and is reversible. The procedure was done in Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Proj. 8, QC and was really quick and non-invasive. 

**UPDATE 09/26/2018**: I will no longer answer questions about how to contact Likhaan and whether you can walk-in or not.

Hi! This will be a very lengthy post containing a brief overview on what this contraceptive method is, and then focusing on the procedure + post-insertion. I'm doing this because in the months I've researched about a contraceptive implant in the PH, I have come up with very little information (even on this sub!) and I want to give you guys an insight into another option. At the end of this post, I have a few links and a tl;dr!

I will say this beforehand though: *If you have a deathly fear of injections, this might not be the method for you.*

**What is a contraceptive implant?**

**The contraceptive implant is a stick they insert in your arm**, between your skin and muscle, that prevents pregnancies **99.05% of the time** for both normal *and* perfect use. It's pretty hard to fuck something up when it's already inside your skin. That means less than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant in a year. The only way it fails is that if it breaks, you have sex following the 7 days after insertion, or you were already pregnant prior insertion. You have to replace this **every 3 years**. 

Some things about the implant:

1. It does not prevent against STDs. Use a condom for that.
2. It does not act as an emergency contraceptive unlike IUDs. If you're pregnant, they won't put this in you.
3. Yes, it has side-effects, as is with every hormonal contraceptive. Common ones are lighter to no periods at all, *LOTS* of periods, random spotting, acne, and weight gain. Make sure you've thoroughly researched the side-effects. What one person experienced may not be what you will experience. Your experience can be better or worse than others' because **each body is different and will react differently to the implant**.

You can also Google for more info.

**Procedure**

So I got my contraceptive implant, *Implanon* (an American brand), last June 27. I got it inserted in the Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Ofelia St., Brgy. Bahay Toro, Project 8, Quezon City. They have other branches as well; they have two in Tondo (Vitas, and Delpan), and others which I am not aware of. 

The contraceptive implant is **free**. Why is it free?, you ask. That's because Likhaan is an NGO that primarily focuses on women in marginalized communities. You can't exactly make poor people get contraceptives if they cost money. So yeah. From what I've read, OB-GYNEs usually charge 8-10k.

I went on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't particularly busy. There was just one person before me. The people there are nice and friendly; *super non-judgmental* especially since I'm a minor (17) and I don't exactly look marginalized. They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. 

The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

They have other branches as well; they have two in Tondo (Vitas, and Delpan), and others which I am not aware of.

I went on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't particularly busy. There was just one person before me. The people there are nice and friendly; *super non-judgmental* especially since I'm a minor (17) and I don't exactly look marginalized. They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. 

The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

That's pretty much it! I was told to take Mefenamic Acid if the pain gets too much. Never had to take any, though.

**TL;DR:** The contraceptive implant is a stick thing in your arm that's 99.95% effective (as effective or even more than a tubal ligation or an IUD) which has to be replaced every 3 years and is reversible. The procedure was done in Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Proj. 8, QC and was really quick and non-invasive. 

**UPDATE 09/26/2018**: I will no longer answer questions about how to contact Likhaan and whether you can walk-in or not.

Do you really think I was actually taught? Curiosity about human sexuality is normal especially for people my age, but it's the decision to take precautions is what's made consciously. There are LOADS of people out there who are older than me but are less informed about birth control. Just because you're older doesn't necessarily mean you're wiser. 
People who try to shelter kids from sex education and related information are the reason why teenage pregnancies are so prevalent. It's not about encouraging or teaching kids to have sex because whether you prohibit them or not, they will probably still do it. It's teaching them how to be careful and take the necessary precautions.",1,t1_d4yndfn,9,r/Philippines,8,725,denying

Hi! This will be a very lengthy post containing a brief overview on what this contraceptive method is, and then focusing on the procedure + post-insertion. I'm doing this because in the months I've researched about a contraceptive implant in the PH, I have come up with very little information (even on this sub!) and I want to give you guys an insight into another option. At the end of this post, I have a few links and a tl;dr!

I will say this beforehand though: *If you have a deathly fear of injections, this might not be the method for you.*

**What is a contraceptive implant?**

**The contraceptive implant is a stick they insert in your arm**, between your skin and muscle, that prevents pregnancies **99.05% of the time** for both normal *and* perfect use. It's pretty hard to fuck something up when it's already inside your skin. That means less than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant in a year. The only way it fails is that if it breaks, you have sex following the 7 days after insertion, or you were already pregnant prior insertion. You have to replace this **every 3 years**. 

Some things about the implant:

1. It does not prevent against STDs. Use a condom for that.
2. It does not act as an emergency contraceptive unlike IUDs. If you're pregnant, they won't put this in you.
3. Yes, it has side-effects, as is with every hormonal contraceptive. Common ones are lighter to no periods at all, *LOTS* of periods, random spotting, acne, and weight gain. Make sure you've thoroughly researched the side-effects. What one person experienced may not be what you will experience. Your experience can be better or worse than others' because **each body is different and will react differently to the implant**.

You can also Google for more info.

**Procedure**

So I got my contraceptive implant, *Implanon* (an American brand), last June 27. I got it inserted in the Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Ofelia St., Brgy. Bahay Toro, Project 8, Quezon City. They have other branches as well; they have two in Tondo (Vitas, and Delpan), and others which I am not aware of. 

The contraceptive implant is **free**. Why is it free?, you ask. That's because Likhaan is an NGO that primarily focuses on women in marginalized communities. You can't exactly make poor people get contraceptives if they cost money. So yeah. From what I've read, OB-GYNEs usually charge 8-10k.

I went on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't particularly busy. There was just one person before me. The people there are nice and friendly; *super non-judgmental* especially since I'm a minor (17) and I don't exactly look marginalized. They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. 

The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

That's pretty much it! I was told to take Mefenamic Acid if the pain gets too much. Never had to take any, though.

* The bruise could look pretty prominent on your arm. If you live with people who would not approve of this then I don't really know how to hide this from them.

Hi! This will be a very lengthy post containing a brief overview on what this contraceptive method is, and then focusing on the procedure + post-insertion. I'm doing this because in the months I've researched about a contraceptive implant in the PH, I have come up with very little information (even on this sub!) and I want to give you guys an insight into another option. At the end of this post, I have a few links and a tl;dr!

I will say this beforehand though: *If you have a deathly fear of injections, this might not be the method for you.*

**What is a contraceptive implant?**

**The contraceptive implant is a stick they insert in your arm**, between your skin and muscle, that prevents pregnancies **99.05% of the time** for both normal *and* perfect use. It's pretty hard to fuck something up when it's already inside your skin. That means less than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant in a year. The only way it fails is that if it breaks, you have sex following the 7 days after insertion, or you were already pregnant prior insertion. You have to replace this **every 3 years**. 

Some things about the implant:

1. It does not prevent against STDs. Use a condom for that.
2. It does not act as an emergency contraceptive unlike IUDs. If you're pregnant, they won't put this in you.
3. Yes, it has side-effects, as is with every hormonal contraceptive. Common ones are lighter to no periods at all, *LOTS* of periods, random spotting, acne, and weight gain. Make sure you've thoroughly researched the side-effects. What one person experienced may not be what you will experience. Your experience can be better or worse than others' because **each body is different and will react differently to the implant**.

You can also Google for more info.

**Procedure**

So I got my contraceptive implant, *Implanon* (an American brand), last June 27. I got it inserted in the Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Ofelia St., Brgy. Bahay Toro, Project 8, Quezon City. They have other branches as well; they have two in Tondo (Vitas, and Delpan), and others which I am not aware of. 

The contraceptive implant is **free**. Why is it free?, you ask. That's because Likhaan is an NGO that primarily focuses on women in marginalized communities. You can't exactly make poor people get contraceptives if they cost money. So yeah. From what I've read, OB-GYNEs usually charge 8-10k.

I went on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't particularly busy. There was just one person before me. The people there are nice and friendly; *super non-judgmental* especially since I'm a minor (17) and I don't exactly look marginalized. They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. 

The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

I think, in the other situation, the problem was caused by the fact that the contraceptives were implanted during a medical mission. So when it was time to remove the implant, the people didn't know where to turn to.

But if the contraceptive was implanted by a clinic, as in this case, there is a fixed location where people can go to, when it's time to have the implant removed. The clinic will have a record of the original procedure, and should have the means to remove the contraceptive. 

Hopefully the procedure will be free, or at least, not too expensive for minor surgery. Thanks again.",2,t1_d5dij8y,2,r/Philippines,0,658,supporting

They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. 

The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

That's pretty much it! I was told to take Mefenamic Acid if the pain gets too much. Never had to take any, though. 

**AFTERNOTES + LINKS**

* The bruise could look pretty prominent on your arm. If you live with people who would not approve of this then I don't really know how to hide this from them. It's probably also important to note that you should consider wearing a cardigan or something lest you want others to think you're a domestic abuse victim.
* [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/3WUAE) containing some pics of the bruise and a few other things if you'd like to see.
* If this is your first time to get a contraceptive, I wouldn't recommend having an implant as the first method. Try Pills first, or something.
* **If you want Likhaan's phone number, feel free to shoot me a PM!** The ones lying around on the Internet are mostly outdated, lol.
* I would like to thank /r/BirthControl for info about the Implanon, mainly about experiences during and while on it! It's a pretty handy resource for all kinds of contraceptives.
* PGH's Ortoll Primary Reproductive Health Care Center also has free Implanon, I think, but they've been out of stock for God knows how long. Won't hurt to call them to check though.

**TL;DR:** The contraceptive implant is a stick thing in your arm that's 99.95% effective (as effective or even more than a tubal ligation or an IUD) which has to be replaced every 3 years and is reversible. The procedure was done in Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Proj. 8, QC and was really quick and non-invasive. 

**UPDATE 09/26/2018**: I will no longer answer questions about how to contact Likhaan and whether you can walk-in or not.

Hi! This will be a very lengthy post containing a brief overview on what this contraceptive method is, and then focusing on the procedure + post-insertion. I'm doing this because in the months I've researched about a contraceptive implant in the PH, I have come up with very little information (even on this sub!) and I want to give you guys an insight into another option. At the end of this post, I have a few links and a tl;dr!

I will say this beforehand though: *If you have a deathly fear of injections, this might not be the method for you.*

**What is a contraceptive implant?**

**The contraceptive implant is a stick they insert in your arm**, between your skin and muscle, that prevents pregnancies **99.05% of the time** for both normal *and* perfect use. It's pretty hard to fuck something up when it's already inside your skin. That means less than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant in a year. The only way it fails is that if it breaks, you have sex following the 7 days after insertion, or you were already pregnant prior insertion. You have to replace this **every 3 years**. 

Some things about the implant:

1. It does not prevent against STDs. Use a condom for that.
2. It does not act as an emergency contraceptive unlike IUDs. If you're pregnant, they won't put this in you.
3. Yes, it has side-effects, as is with every hormonal contraceptive. Common ones are lighter to no periods at all, *LOTS* of periods, random spotting, acne, and weight gain. Make sure you've thoroughly researched the side-effects. What one person experienced may not be what you will experience. Your experience can be better or worse than others' because **each body is different and will react differently to the implant**.

You can also Google for more info.

**Procedure**

So I got my contraceptive implant, *Implanon* (an American brand), last June 27. I got it inserted in the Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Ofelia St., Brgy. Bahay Toro, Project 8, Quezon City. They have other branches as well; they have two in Tondo (Vitas, and Delpan), and others which I am not aware of. 

The contraceptive implant is **free**. Why is it free?, you ask. That's because Likhaan is an NGO that primarily focuses on women in marginalized communities. You can't exactly make poor people get contraceptives if they cost money. So yeah. From what I've read, OB-GYNEs usually charge 8-10k.

I went on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't particularly busy. There was just one person before me. The people there are nice and friendly; *super non-judgmental* especially since I'm a minor (17) and I don't exactly look marginalized. They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

I think that it's just a fact of life that people, including younger people, find sex interesting, fascinating, tempting and all that. As people get older, they learn about sex and then they will probably want to have sex.

It's not enough to tell young people to not have sex. If this strategy worked, society wouldn't have problems with unwanted pregnancies or STDs in younger people.

Instead, younger people also need to be given knowledge so that even if they do engage in sexual activity, they can avoid such things as STDs, unwanted pregnancies or other complications.

Unfortunately, many young people aren't taught about these things. This leads to young people believing that they won't get pregnant if it's the first time, or that the withdrawal method will be sufficient, or they don't realize just how at risk they are for contracting genital warts, HIV or some other STD.

OP is doing a good thing here, by providing useful information that all people can use, not just young individuals, but also older women who are trying to avoid getting pregnant.",2,t1_d4ynpzt,2,r/Philippines,0,1078,supporting

They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. 

The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

That's pretty much it! I was told to take Mefenamic Acid if the pain gets too much. Never had to take any, though.

3. Yes, it has side-effects, as is with every hormonal contraceptive. Common ones are lighter to no periods at all, *LOTS* of periods, random spotting, acne, and weight gain. Make sure you've thoroughly researched the side-effects. What one person experienced may not be what you will experience. Your experience can be better or worse than others' because **each body is different and will react differently to the implant**.

You can also Google for more info.

**Procedure**

So I got my contraceptive implant, *Implanon* (an American brand), last June 27. I got it inserted in the Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Ofelia St., Brgy. Bahay Toro, Project 8, Quezon City. They have other branches as well; they have two in Tondo (Vitas, and Delpan), and others which I am not aware of. 

The contraceptive implant is **free**. Why is it free?, you ask. That's because Likhaan is an NGO that primarily focuses on women in marginalized communities. You can't exactly make poor people get contraceptives if they cost money. So yeah. From what I've read, OB-GYNEs usually charge 8-10k.

I went on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't particularly busy. There was just one person before me. The people there are nice and friendly; *super non-judgmental* especially since I'm a minor (17) and I don't exactly look marginalized. They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. 

The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

That's pretty much it! I was told to take Mefenamic Acid if the pain gets too much. Never had to take any, though. 

**AFTERNOTES + LINKS**

* The bruise could look pretty prominent on your arm. If you live with people who would not approve of this then I don't really know how to hide this from them. It's probably also important to note that you should consider wearing a cardigan or something lest you want others to think you're a domestic abuse victim.
* [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/3WUAE) containing some pics of the bruise and a few other things if you'd like to see.
* If this is your first time to get a contraceptive, I wouldn't recommend having an implant as the first method. Try Pills first, or something.
* **If you want Likhaan's phone number, feel free to shoot me a PM!** The ones lying around on the Internet are mostly outdated, lol.
* I would like to thank /r/BirthControl for info about the Implanon, mainly about experiences during and while on it! It's a pretty handy resource for all kinds of contraceptives.
* PGH's Ortoll Primary Reproductive Health Care Center also has free Implanon, I think, but they've been out of stock for God knows how long. Won't hurt to call them to check though.

If you have more questions, send me a PM or comment below ♥

**TL;DR:** The contraceptive implant is a stick thing in your arm that's 99.95% effective (as effective or even more than a tubal ligation or an IUD) which has to be replaced every 3 years and is reversible. The procedure was done in Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Proj. 8, QC and was really quick and non-invasive. 

**UPDATE 09/26/2018**: I will no longer answer questions about how to contact Likhaan and whether you can walk-in or not. They now have a Facebook Page called ""Likhaan Center for Women's Health Inc."" which has the contact information for ALL of their branches on their PINNED post. Please understand that I keep on getting repetitive PMs about this so please make use of the accessible info from their FB page.",chiarassu,"Like what hellosunmaid said, it's subdermal. No nerves are supposed to be hit. If, after the initial bruising has healed, there is still pain where the implant is, there's probably a problem. It's probably because the implant split into two and the ends are poking further downwards. But with the strength of the rod, it's unlikely to happen.

The reason there's a bruising after the implant is inserted is because there's some trauma from the force of the insertion of the implant. It's supposed to heal around it. ",3,t1_d4xwhpc,2,r/Philippines,0,518,denying

Hi! This will be a very lengthy post containing a brief overview on what this contraceptive method is, and then focusing on the procedure + post-insertion. I'm doing this because in the months I've researched about a contraceptive implant in the PH, I have come up with very little information (even on this sub!) and I want to give you guys an insight into another option. At the end of this post, I have a few links and a tl;dr!

I will say this beforehand though: *If you have a deathly fear of injections, this might not be the method for you.*

**What is a contraceptive implant?**

**The contraceptive implant is a stick they insert in your arm**, between your skin and muscle, that prevents pregnancies **99.05% of the time** for both normal *and* perfect use. It's pretty hard to fuck something up when it's already inside your skin. That means less than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant in a year. The only way it fails is that if it breaks, you have sex following the 7 days after insertion, or you were already pregnant prior insertion. You have to replace this **every 3 years**. 

Some things about the implant:

1. It does not prevent against STDs. Use a condom for that.
2. It does not act as an emergency contraceptive unlike IUDs. If you're pregnant, they won't put this in you.
3. Yes, it has side-effects, as is with every hormonal contraceptive. Common ones are lighter to no periods at all, *LOTS* of periods, random spotting, acne, and weight gain.

For me, it's not that I have *a lot* of sex. But on the off-chance that I do or plan to, I want to be ready and I don't want to become all anxious afterwards because I think I'll get pregnant. When I was on the pill, I was scared of being that 1-9% of failure every time just because I was dumb enough to not take my meds consistently (and I stopped taking the pill because I sucked at being consistent!). 

I don't want to have sex and have fun right now, and then be terrified of the consequences afterwards to the point that the next time I do it, I'm already traumatized. That I won't find enjoyment in sex anymore. I've already had 3 pregnancy scares before and though a lot of them were just me overreacting, there's still no such thing as being too careful when it comes to preventing unintended pregnancies.",3,t1_d4yodaz,4,r/Philippines,4,1019,commenting

**What is a contraceptive implant?**

**The contraceptive implant is a stick they insert in your arm**, between your skin and muscle, that prevents pregnancies **99.05% of the time** for both normal *and* perfect use. It's pretty hard to fuck something up when it's already inside your skin. That means less than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant in a year.

**Procedure**

So I got my contraceptive implant, *Implanon* (an American brand), last June 27. I got it inserted in the Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Ofelia St., Brgy. Bahay Toro, Project 8, Quezon City. They have other branches as well; they have two in Tondo (Vitas, and Delpan), and others which I am not aware of. 

The contraceptive implant is **free**. Why is it free?, you ask. That's because Likhaan is an NGO that primarily focuses on women in marginalized communities. You can't exactly make poor people get contraceptives if they cost money. So yeah. From what I've read, OB-GYNEs usually charge 8-10k.

I went on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't particularly busy. There was just one person before me. The people there are nice and friendly; *super non-judgmental* especially since I'm a minor (17) and I don't exactly look marginalized. They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. 

The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

That's pretty much it! I was told to take Mefenamic Acid if the pain gets too much. Never had to take any, though. 

**AFTERNOTES + LINKS**

* The bruise could look pretty prominent on your arm. If you live with people who would not approve of this then I don't really know how to hide this from them. It's probably also important to note that you should consider wearing a cardigan or something lest you want others to think you're a domestic abuse victim.
* [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/3WUAE) containing some pics of the bruise and a few other things if you'd like to see.
* If this is your first time to get a contraceptive, I wouldn't recommend having an implant as the first method. Try Pills first, or something.

* I would like to thank /r/BirthControl for info about the Implanon, mainly about experiences during and while on it! It's a pretty handy resource for all kinds of contraceptives.

I'm doing this because in the months I've researched about a contraceptive implant in the PH, I have come up with very little information (even on this sub!) and I want to give you guys an insight into another option. At the end of this post, I have a few links and a tl;dr!

I will say this beforehand though: *If you have a deathly fear of injections, this might not be the method for you.*

**What is a contraceptive implant?**

**The contraceptive implant is a stick they insert in your arm**, between your skin and muscle, that prevents pregnancies **99.05% of the time** for both normal *and* perfect use. It's pretty hard to fuck something up when it's already inside your skin. That means less than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant in a year. The only way it fails is that if it breaks, you have sex following the 7 days after insertion, or you were already pregnant prior insertion. You have to replace this **every 3 years**. 

Some things about the implant:

1. It does not prevent against STDs. Use a condom for that.
2. It does not act as an emergency contraceptive unlike IUDs. If you're pregnant, they won't put this in you.
3. Yes, it has side-effects, as is with every hormonal contraceptive. Common ones are lighter to no periods at all, *LOTS* of periods, random spotting, acne, and weight gain. Make sure you've thoroughly researched the side-effects. What one person experienced may not be what you will experience. Your experience can be better or worse than others' because **each body is different and will react differently to the implant**.

You can also Google for more info.

**Procedure**

So I got my contraceptive implant, *Implanon* (an American brand), last June 27. I got it inserted in the Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Ofelia St., Brgy. Bahay Toro, Project 8, Quezon City. They have other branches as well; they have two in Tondo (Vitas, and Delpan), and others which I am not aware of. 

The contraceptive implant is **free**. Why is it free?, you ask. That's because Likhaan is an NGO that primarily focuses on women in marginalized communities. You can't exactly make poor people get contraceptives if they cost money. So yeah. From what I've read, OB-GYNEs usually charge 8-10k.

I went on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't particularly busy. There was just one person before me. The people there are nice and friendly; *super non-judgmental* especially since I'm a minor (17) and I don't exactly look marginalized. They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.

The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. 

The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.

She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.

That's pretty much it! I was told to take Mefenamic Acid if the pain gets too much. Never had to take any, though. 

**AFTERNOTES + LINKS**

* The bruise could look pretty prominent on your arm. If you live with people who would not approve of this then I don't really know how to hide this from them. It's probably also important to note that you should consider wearing a cardigan or something lest you want others to think you're a domestic abuse victim.
* [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/3WUAE) containing some pics of the bruise and a few other things if you'd like to see.
* If this is your first time to get a contraceptive, I wouldn't recommend having an implant as the first method. Try Pills first, or something.
* **If you want Likhaan's phone number, feel free to shoot me a PM!** The ones lying around on the Internet are mostly outdated, lol.
* I would like to thank /r/BirthControl for info about the Implanon, mainly about experiences during and while on it! It's a pretty handy resource for all kinds of contraceptives.
* PGH's Ortoll Primary Reproductive Health Care Center also has free Implanon, I think, but they've been out of stock for God knows how long. Won't hurt to call them to check though.

**TL;DR:** The contraceptive implant is a stick thing in your arm that's 99.95% effective (as effective or even more than a tubal ligation or an IUD) which has to be replaced every 3 years and is reversible. The procedure was done in Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Proj. 8, QC and was really quick and non-invasive. 

**UPDATE 09/26/2018**: I will no longer answer questions about how to contact Likhaan and whether you can walk-in or not.

dg5lo7g,Update on Implanon in the Philippines 2017,"Hi everyone! This takes off from this post (couldn't comment an update since it was already archived) https://redd.it/4r2tl4 Thank you so much to chiarassu and childfreefilipina for their very detailed and informative posts and comments about contraception in the Philippines! You two inspired me to help contribute to the ongoing conversation about birth control in the Philippines. ⊂((・▽・))⊃

&nbsp;

Since I couldn't find the latest info on Implanon (late 2016 to early 2017), hopefully this helps anyone who needs info about Implanon (or any other form of contraception) and where to get it for free. d=(´▽｀)=b

&nbsp;

TL; DR: Implanon is still available for free in Likhaan Center for Women's Health. They also have other contraceptives you can avail so hurry while another filibuster against contraceptives is still in the works!

 &nbsp;

The free Implanon is still available in Likhaan Center for Women's Health. I went there on April 12, 2017. The office was supposed to be half day as the next day was a Maundy Thursday. I went to Likhaan Center for Women's Health in their Main Office in Ofelia Subdivision. (The arc says Ofelia Village but same thing)  

**FAQs about Implanon:** 

&nbsp;

- Synthetic progesterone rod (Etonorgestrel) inserted subdermally inside your arm. The hormone used is the same as the one used in DMPAs or injectables. 


- The nurse suggested that if it was my first time for an implant, it might be best to start with an injectable that lasts for 3 months. Since the hormone used is the same, the side effects are most likely similar. You can do a sort of test drive with the injectable and record any side effect that you have with it. Then you can go back to the center and discuss alternatives if you feel that it's not for you. 


- Lasts for 3 years 


- Best implanted when you're menstruating so that you're sure that you're not pregnant

**How to get to Likhaan Center for Women's Health (Main Office):**


(I was coming in from the Pasig-Mandaluyong area) MRT to North EDSA. From Trinoma, ride an FX (Novaliches-SM North/Trinoma) and ask the driver to alight at Ofelia Village. Or you can also just use the Angkas app (which I used), or Grab or Uber. Just make sure to select the address as Ofelia Village. Don't select the Times address as that was their old address. I tried going there once but I couldn't find it. Only when I asked the nurse about it did I find out it no longer existed. If you're going there via Uber/Grab/Angkas or bringing your own car, the first route Waze or Google Maps usually suggests is a small minor gate almost beside Mindanao Ave. Ask instead to go through the main entrance of Ofelia Subdivision. 



They have 7 other branches such as in Navotas, San Andres (Paco, Manila). The Main Branch is open from Mondays to Fridays, 9 am to 4 pm, while their branch clinics are usually open from Tuesdays to Saturdays. Some branches specialize in counselling, while others specialize in family planning. Some of their branches will soon have ""paanakans"" or birthing clinics. The nurse and the midwife are usually at the main branch from Wednesdays to Fridays, so those are the best times to visit to get administered contraceptives such as injectables and implants. 



The exterior is a two (?)- storied white house with a brown gate. There's also a sign on the gate. When I entered, I was ushered in by a busy but friendly woman, and asked me to wait for a few minutes. Not long after, I was called by the nurse and led to the clinic. The nurse was very friendly and allowed me to ask any question I had in mind about the procedure, contraceptives, etc. 

&nbsp;

**Pre-insertion procedure:**
-  The nurse asks about your medical history and creates a medical record for you. It's highly recommended that you keep track of EVERYTHING: your last period, your BC methods such as your BC Pill intake, any symptoms that you've had when you were on your BC methods (especially if you've had spotting) If this is your first time getting any form of hormonal contraception, the nurse might ask you about the nearest approximate date of your last sexual contact. Now I know some people might be scared or worried about detailing their medical histories, but you should always be as honest as possible. Likhaan is a safe place where you can talk about it without judgement. It's very important to mention if you have heart disease, liver disease, a smoking habit, etc. Why? This is so that the nurse can give you the best recommendation possible and brief you about the possible side effect/s of the BC method you have chosen. 


-  After asking about your medical history, the nurse asks you whether you are a lefty or a righty. Since I'm right-handed, the implant would be placed on my left arm and vice versa. 

**Insertion:**

 
-  The nurse leads you to a table where you lie down while s/he gets the Implanon. 


-   You are asked to lift your arm and place your hand under your head. 


-   The nurse rubs alcohol on your skin 


-   After a few more minutes of preparation, the nurse injects you with anesthesia. NOTE: Talk to the nurse about any allergies you have with medications before proceeding. I'd have to say this was the most painful part of the procedure. The ""bite"" from the anesthesia still lingers even if the whole place is numb. It takes a few seconds (probably around a minute or two, tops) before the area becomes numb. The nurse would pinch you and ask you if you still feel the pinch. I had to be pinched a few times because I wasn't sure whether the pain was from the pinch or the anesthesia hahaha (If you're nervous about the injection for the anesthetic, do NOT drink coffee before going there like I did. щ(ಥДಥщ) ) 


- The nurse inserts the rod through a sort of stapler-like device. I felt nothing at all, save for the lingering pain from the anesthesia. 


- Right after the implant is inserted, the nurse asks you to feel the implant and shows you how to check if it's in place or not. Again, the implant doesn't usually move but if you can't feel the implant it means that it has been inserted the wrong way and wouldn't be effective. It has to be removed and reinserted properly. The nurse at the center was very proficient and professional, most likely having done this to hundreds of women so you don't have to worry at all about the implant being inserted improperly. 
- The nurse puts a Band-aid on the site of insertion, then gauze to make sure the wound doesn't get infected. 


**Post-insertion:**
-  The nurse gives you instructions in how to care for your wound. Be very careful to change your bandages on time and to make sure that your wound never gets wet!


-  S/he also advises you to abstain from sex for 7 days ಥ_ಥ but it's better to make sure that the implant is working well before you engage in unprotected sex ┌╏ º □ º ╏┐ 


-  When the anesthesia subsides, you can take mefenamic acid or paracetamol to help with the pain if it makes you feel uncomfortable. 

-  You're given a card with the date of insertion of the rod. Then, you're to go and enjoy your life as you please! o(*^▽^*)o

**Removal:** 
The card has a date when you're supposed to remove it. From what I read, it's as effective as a tubal ligation, but not permanent. To remove it, the nurse will make a small incision in your arm and remove the rod. The nurse can then replace it with a new rod but if you're aiming for a pregnancy, s/he won't replace it anymore. Fertility resumes almost immediately upon removal of the rod without any backup, meaning your period will go back to how it was before you started hormonal contraceptives. 



**IMPORTANT:**


Track everything! If you have mood swings, headaches, weight gain (though I was assured the weight gain would be at most 1 kg during the 3 years it's on.) , anything! If you are not ""hiyang"" (it isn't compatible with the way your body works), you can always go back to the Center, have it removed and discuss other contraceptive methods. As mentioned earlier, it might be best if you start out with an injectable before using the Implanon so that you have an idea if it works for you or not. Clue (https://www.helloclue.com/) is a free app available on iOS and Android, and is very easy to use to track almost everything! I always refer to it when talking to doctors about my history, and gives them a more accurate picture about symptoms and recommended medications. (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧


Likhaan also offers a myriad of contraceptives available: pills (both combination and progestin-only pills), implants (IUDs and Implanon), condoms, etc. You can ask about their other available contraceptives through their phone number. If you need it, just ask :) 


Their website and FB hasn't been updated since their transfer from Times to Ofelia, but it'll be updated very soon. 


Hope this helps update the information! Some helpful links on implants are:

*Update*

It's been around more than 14 days and not much problems with the implant. My bruise is almost disappearing, but during the first few days of getting the implant I had to cover it up lest someone think that someone hurt me. I've noticed that even though I am proud of my decision to get one, I sometimes end up saying that I bumped my arm or had an accident to avoid telling people that I got an implant. :/ Still a but worried about being judged even though I'd shout any type of information about contraceptives as much as I can. Do you feel the same way? :( ",hellosunmaid,"Thanks for sharing your experience, OP!! Implants and other contraceptives are definitely available and affordable or even free at NGO clinics. No need to go to a private OB gyne who might be judgy! NGO clinics also have healthcare providers and even provide free counseling.

Aside from Likhaan, check out FPOP (clinic in Tandang Sora, QC) and Friendly Care (clinics in Fairview, QC; Shaw Blvd, Pasig; Cubao, QC and a couple of other branches outside Manila)!

My bruise is almost disappearing, but during the first few days of getting the implant I had to cover it up lest someone think that someone hurt me. I've noticed that even though I am proud of my decision to get one, I sometimes end up saying that I bumped my arm or had an accident to avoid telling people that I got an implant. :/ Still a but worried about being judged even though I'd shout any type of information about contraceptives as much as I can. Do you feel the same way? :( ",esereth18,Hi! What about removal after 3 years? Is it still free?,0,t3_64whuh,2,r/Philippines,4,55,commenting

This takes off from this post (couldn't comment an update since it was already archived) https://redd.it/4r2tl4 Thank you so much to chiarassu and childfreefilipina for their very detailed and informative posts and comments about contraception in the Philippines! You two inspired me to help contribute to the ongoing conversation about birth control in the Philippines. ⊂((・▽・))⊃

&nbsp;

Since I couldn't find the latest info on Implanon (late 2016 to early 2017), hopefully this helps anyone who needs info about Implanon (or any other form of contraception) and where to get it for free. d=(´▽｀)=b

&nbsp;

TL; DR: Implanon is still available for free in Likhaan Center for Women's Health. They also have other contraceptives you can avail so hurry while another filibuster against contraceptives is still in the works!

 &nbsp;

The free Implanon is still available in Likhaan Center for Women's Health. I went there on April 12, 2017. The office was supposed to be half day as the next day was a Maundy Thursday. I went to Likhaan Center for Women's Health in their Main Office in Ofelia Subdivision. (The arc says Ofelia Village but same thing)  

**FAQs about Implanon:** 

&nbsp;

- Synthetic progesterone rod (Etonorgestrel) inserted subdermally inside your arm. The hormone used is the same as the one used in DMPAs or injectables. 


- The nurse suggested that if it was my first time for an implant, it might be best to start with an injectable that lasts for 3 months. Since the hormone used is the same, the side effects are most likely similar. You can do a sort of test drive with the injectable and record any side effect that you have with it. Then you can go back to the center and discuss alternatives if you feel that it's not for you. 


- Lasts for 3 years 


- Best implanted when you're menstruating so that you're sure that you're not pregnant

**How to get to Likhaan Center for Women's Health (Main Office):**


(I was coming in from the Pasig-Mandaluyong area) MRT to North EDSA. From Trinoma, ride an FX (Novaliches-SM North/Trinoma) and ask the driver to alight at Ofelia Village. Or you can also just use the Angkas app (which I used), or Grab or Uber. Just make sure to select the address as Ofelia Village. Don't select the Times address as that was their old address. I tried going there once but I couldn't find it. Only when I asked the nurse about it did I find out it no longer existed. If you're going there via Uber/Grab/Angkas or bringing your own car, the first route Waze or Google Maps usually suggests is a small minor gate almost beside Mindanao Ave. Ask instead to go through the main entrance of Ofelia Subdivision. 



They have 7 other branches such as in Navotas, San Andres (Paco, Manila). The Main Branch is open from Mondays to Fridays, 9 am to 4 pm, while their branch clinics are usually open from Tuesdays to Saturdays. Some branches specialize in counselling, while others specialize in family planning. Some of their branches will soon have ""paanakans"" or birthing clinics. The nurse and the midwife are usually at the main branch from Wednesdays to Fridays, so those are the best times to visit to get administered contraceptives such as injectables and implants. 



The exterior is a two (?)- storied white house with a brown gate. There's also a sign on the gate. When I entered, I was ushered in by a busy but friendly woman, and asked me to wait for a few minutes. Not long after, I was called by the nurse and led to the clinic. The nurse was very friendly and allowed me to ask any question I had in mind about the procedure, contraceptives, etc. 

&nbsp;

**Pre-insertion procedure:**
-  The nurse asks about your medical history and creates a medical record for you. It's highly recommended that you keep track of EVERYTHING: your last period, your BC methods such as your BC Pill intake, any symptoms that you've had when you were on your BC methods (especially if you've had spotting) If this is your first time getting any form of hormonal contraception, the nurse might ask you about the nearest approximate date of your last sexual contact. Now I know some people might be scared or worried about detailing their medical histories, but you should always be as honest as possible. Likhaan is a safe place where you can talk about it without judgement. It's very important to mention if you have heart disease, liver disease, a smoking habit, etc. Why? This is so that the nurse can give you the best recommendation possible and brief you about the possible side effect/s of the BC method you have chosen. 


-  After asking about your medical history, the nurse asks you whether you are a lefty or a righty. Since I'm right-handed, the implant would be placed on my left arm and vice versa. 

**Insertion:**

 
-  The nurse leads you to a table where you lie down while s/he gets the Implanon. 


-   You are asked to lift your arm and place your hand under your head. 


-   The nurse rubs alcohol on your skin 


-   After a few more minutes of preparation, the nurse injects you with anesthesia. NOTE: Talk to the nurse about any allergies you have with medications before proceeding. I'd have to say this was the most painful part of the procedure. The ""bite"" from the anesthesia still lingers even if the whole place is numb. It takes a few seconds (probably around a minute or two, tops) before the area becomes numb. The nurse would pinch you and ask you if you still feel the pinch. I had to be pinched a few times because I wasn't sure whether the pain was from the pinch or the anesthesia hahaha (If you're nervous about the injection for the anesthetic, do NOT drink coffee before going there like I did. щ(ಥДಥщ) ) 


- The nurse inserts the rod through a sort of stapler-like device. I felt nothing at all, save for the lingering pain from the anesthesia. 


- Right after the implant is inserted, the nurse asks you to feel the implant and shows you how to check if it's in place or not. Again, the implant doesn't usually move but if you can't feel the implant it means that it has been inserted the wrong way and wouldn't be effective. It has to be removed and reinserted properly. The nurse at the center was very proficient and professional, most likely having done this to hundreds of women so you don't have to worry at all about the implant being inserted improperly. 
- The nurse puts a Band-aid on the site of insertion, then gauze to make sure the wound doesn't get infected. 


**Post-insertion:**
-  The nurse gives you instructions in how to care for your wound. Be very careful to change your bandages on time and to make sure that your wound never gets wet!


-  S/he also advises you to abstain from sex for 7 days ಥ_ಥ but it's better to make sure that the implant is working well before you engage in unprotected sex ┌╏ º □ º ╏┐ 


-  When the anesthesia subsides, you can take mefenamic acid or paracetamol to help with the pain if it makes you feel uncomfortable. 

-  You're given a card with the date of insertion of the rod. Then, you're to go and enjoy your life as you please! o(*^▽^*)o

**Removal:** 
The card has a date when you're supposed to remove it. From what I read, it's as effective as a tubal ligation, but not permanent. To remove it, the nurse will make a small incision in your arm and remove the rod. The nurse can then replace it with a new rod but if you're aiming for a pregnancy, s/he won't replace it anymore. Fertility resumes almost immediately upon removal of the rod without any backup, meaning your period will go back to how it was before you started hormonal contraceptives. 



**IMPORTANT:**


Track everything! If you have mood swings, headaches, weight gain (though I was assured the weight gain would be at most 1 kg during the 3 years it's on.) , anything! If you are not ""hiyang"" (it isn't compatible with the way your body works), you can always go back to the Center, have it removed and discuss other contraceptive methods. As mentioned earlier, it might be best if you start out with an injectable before using the Implanon so that you have an idea if it works for you or not. Clue (https://www.helloclue.com/) is a free app available on iOS and Android, and is very easy to use to track almost everything! I always refer to it when talking to doctors about my history, and gives them a more accurate picture about symptoms and recommended medications. (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧


Likhaan also offers a myriad of contraceptives available: pills (both combination and progestin-only pills), implants (IUDs and Implanon), condoms, etc. You can ask about their other available contraceptives through their phone number. If you need it, just ask :) 


Their website and FB hasn't been updated since their transfer from Times to Ofelia, but it'll be updated very soon.

The free Implanon is still available in Likhaan Center for Women's Health. I went there on April 12, 2017. The office was supposed to be half day as the next day was a Maundy Thursday. I went to Likhaan Center for Women's Health in their Main Office in Ofelia Subdivision. (The arc says Ofelia Village but same thing)  

**FAQs about Implanon:** 

&nbsp;

- Synthetic progesterone rod (Etonorgestrel) inserted subdermally inside your arm. The hormone used is the same as the one used in DMPAs or injectables. 


- The nurse suggested that if it was my first time for an implant, it might be best to start with an injectable that lasts for 3 months. Since the hormone used is the same, the side effects are most likely similar. You can do a sort of test drive with the injectable and record any side effect that you have with it. Then you can go back to the center and discuss alternatives if you feel that it's not for you. 


- Lasts for 3 years 


- Best implanted when you're menstruating so that you're sure that you're not pregnant

**How to get to Likhaan Center for Women's Health (Main Office):**


(I was coming in from the Pasig-Mandaluyong area) MRT to North EDSA. From Trinoma, ride an FX (Novaliches-SM North/Trinoma) and ask the driver to alight at Ofelia Village. Or you can also just use the Angkas app (which I used), or Grab or Uber. Just make sure to select the address as Ofelia Village. Don't select the Times address as that was their old address. I tried going there once but I couldn't find it. Only when I asked the nurse about it did I find out it no longer existed. If you're going there via Uber/Grab/Angkas or bringing your own car, the first route Waze or Google Maps usually suggests is a small minor gate almost beside Mindanao Ave. Ask instead to go through the main entrance of Ofelia Subdivision. 



They have 7 other branches such as in Navotas, San Andres (Paco, Manila). The Main Branch is open from Mondays to Fridays, 9 am to 4 pm, while their branch clinics are usually open from Tuesdays to Saturdays. Some branches specialize in counselling, while others specialize in family planning. Some of their branches will soon have ""paanakans"" or birthing clinics. The nurse and the midwife are usually at the main branch from Wednesdays to Fridays, so those are the best times to visit to get administered contraceptives such as injectables and implants. 



The exterior is a two (?)- storied white house with a brown gate. There's also a sign on the gate. When I entered, I was ushered in by a busy but friendly woman, and asked me to wait for a few minutes. Not long after, I was called by the nurse and led to the clinic. The nurse was very friendly and allowed me to ask any question I had in mind about the procedure, contraceptives, etc. 

&nbsp;

**Pre-insertion procedure:**
-  The nurse asks about your medical history and creates a medical record for you. It's highly recommended that you keep track of EVERYTHING: your last period, your BC methods such as your BC Pill intake, any symptoms that you've had when you were on your BC methods (especially if you've had spotting) If this is your first time getting any form of hormonal contraception, the nurse might ask you about the nearest approximate date of your last sexual contact. Now I know some people might be scared or worried about detailing their medical histories, but you should always be as honest as possible. Likhaan is a safe place where you can talk about it without judgement. It's very important to mention if you have heart disease, liver disease, a smoking habit, etc. Why? This is so that the nurse can give you the best recommendation possible and brief you about the possible side effect/s of the BC method you have chosen. 


-  After asking about your medical history, the nurse asks you whether you are a lefty or a righty. Since I'm right-handed, the implant would be placed on my left arm and vice versa. 

**Insertion:**

 
-  The nurse leads you to a table where you lie down while s/he gets the Implanon. 


-   You are asked to lift your arm and place your hand under your head. 


-   The nurse rubs alcohol on your skin 


-   After a few more minutes of preparation, the nurse injects you with anesthesia. NOTE: Talk to the nurse about any allergies you have with medications before proceeding. I'd have to say this was the most painful part of the procedure. The ""bite"" from the anesthesia still lingers even if the whole place is numb. It takes a few seconds (probably around a minute or two, tops) before the area becomes numb. The nurse would pinch you and ask you if you still feel the pinch. I had to be pinched a few times because I wasn't sure whether the pain was from the pinch or the anesthesia hahaha (If you're nervous about the injection for the anesthetic, do NOT drink coffee before going there like I did. щ(ಥДಥщ) ) 


- The nurse inserts the rod through a sort of stapler-like device. I felt nothing at all, save for the lingering pain from the anesthesia. 


- Right after the implant is inserted, the nurse asks you to feel the implant and shows you how to check if it's in place or not. Again, the implant doesn't usually move but if you can't feel the implant it means that it has been inserted the wrong way and wouldn't be effective. It has to be removed and reinserted properly. The nurse at the center was very proficient and professional, most likely having done this to hundreds of women so you don't have to worry at all about the implant being inserted improperly. 
- The nurse puts a Band-aid on the site of insertion, then gauze to make sure the wound doesn't get infected. 


**Post-insertion:**
-  The nurse gives you instructions in how to care for your wound. Be very careful to change your bandages on time and to make sure that your wound never gets wet!


-  S/he also advises you to abstain from sex for 7 days ಥ_ಥ but it's better to make sure that the implant is working well before you engage in unprotected sex ┌╏ º □ º ╏┐ 


-  When the anesthesia subsides, you can take mefenamic acid or paracetamol to help with the pain if it makes you feel uncomfortable. 

-  You're given a card with the date of insertion of the rod. Then, you're to go and enjoy your life as you please! o(*^▽^*)o

**Removal:** 
The card has a date when you're supposed to remove it. From what I read, it's as effective as a tubal ligation, but not permanent. To remove it, the nurse will make a small incision in your arm and remove the rod. The nurse can then replace it with a new rod but if you're aiming for a pregnancy, s/he won't replace it anymore. Fertility resumes almost immediately upon removal of the rod without any backup, meaning your period will go back to how it was before you started hormonal contraceptives. 



**IMPORTANT:**


Track everything! If you have mood swings, headaches, weight gain (though I was assured the weight gain would be at most 1 kg during the 3 years it's on.) , anything! If you are not ""hiyang"" (it isn't compatible with the way your body works), you can always go back to the Center, have it removed and discuss other contraceptive methods. As mentioned earlier, it might be best if you start out with an injectable before using the Implanon so that you have an idea if it works for you or not. Clue (https://www.helloclue.com/) is a free app available on iOS and Android, and is very easy to use to track almost everything! I always refer to it when talking to doctors about my history, and gives them a more accurate picture about symptoms and recommended medications. (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧


Likhaan also offers a myriad of contraceptives available: pills (both combination and progestin-only pills), implants (IUDs and Implanon), condoms, etc. You can ask about their other available contraceptives through their phone number. If you need it, just ask :) 


Their website and FB hasn't been updated since their transfer from Times to Ofelia, but it'll be updated very soon.

*Update*

It's been around more than 14 days and not much problems with the implant. My bruise is almost disappearing, but during the first few days of getting the implant I had to cover it up lest someone think that someone hurt me. I've noticed that even though I am proud of my decision to get one, I sometimes end up saying that I bumped my arm or had an accident to avoid telling people that I got an implant. :/ Still a but worried about being judged even though I'd shout any type of information about contraceptives as much as I can.

Do you feel the same way? :( ",karaagegirl,"Hello there! I chose to have a long term BC because I know that I wouldn't be ready for kids anytime soon. (I'm in my early 20s BTW) I also know that I can be very forgetful when it comes to things like vitamins and medicines in general, and I like my beer a bit too much for me to keep taking the Pill. I worry about my liver even though I'm a moderate drinker, so I'm not into the Pill.（＞ｙ＜）

I used to take depo, but it was quite expensive if done with a private doctor. I also didn't like going back to the doctor every 3 months just to get a shot. It has to be within a specific week otherwise you might get pregnant. 

I also took into consideration the fact that the TRO that the SC has placed on the RH Bill is not likely to be lifted anytime soon, and that some methods well already be phased out even as I type this. While continuing the fight for body autonomy for all women in the Philippines, I decided to take the implant. I could have gone with the IUD yes, if I wanted an even longer term type of contraceptive. However, the right time to get an IUD just never really cane up. I was also worried that the recovery time for me to get the IUD would be longer than a weekend. Hormonal IUDs would have been better I think, as it can reduce your period. Copper IUDs make your period heavier, and it might not be suitable for me if I constantly am in the 90/60 blood pressure zone. Maybe it's just me worrying that if my period gets heavier then I might be at risk for anemia. (This fear has not been verified by a medical professional, only by my over thinking) I have been warned by a friend as well that the IUD might make me prone to pelvic inflammation. 

It's been a month since I got the implant and so far, it's going really well for me. Some medical journals have claimed that the effectivity rate is around 0.05%, even better than the copper IUD. I feel it every few hours or so, even though I'm confident that the nurse put it right just because I'm a paranoid parrot (●__●) My libido  changed a bit. It takes me longer to feel desire but again I guess I could also chalk it up to stress. The most noticeable change after the implant was that my skin has dried up. My face feels like sandpaper ಥ_ಥ It could be due to stress and insomnia as well, though. I also havent been taking care of my skin as well as I should. And true to what the nurse had said, I gained weight. ヽ（´ー｀）┌ Worry free eating, as the nurse predicted “ψ(｀∇´)ψ  My moods don't swing to extremes exactly, but my emotions become a lot more intense. I don't get the headaches that I used to get from Depo before so that's definitely a yay. （〜^∇^)〜",1,t1_dhlw0rb,1,r/Philippines,4,2640,commenting

You two inspired me to help contribute to the ongoing conversation about birth control in the Philippines. ⊂((・▽・))⊃

&nbsp;

Since I couldn't find the latest info on Implanon (late 2016 to early 2017), hopefully this helps anyone who needs info about Implanon (or any other form of contraception) and where to get it for free. d=(´▽｀)=b

&nbsp;

TL; DR: Implanon is still available for free in Likhaan Center for Women's Health. They also have other contraceptives you can avail so hurry while another filibuster against contraceptives is still in the works!

 &nbsp;

The free Implanon is still available in Likhaan Center for Women's Health. I went there on April 12, 2017. The office was supposed to be half day as the next day was a Maundy Thursday. I went to Likhaan Center for Women's Health in their Main Office in Ofelia Subdivision. (The arc says Ofelia Village but same thing)  

**FAQs about Implanon:** 

&nbsp;

- Synthetic progesterone rod (Etonorgestrel) inserted subdermally inside your arm. The hormone used is the same as the one used in DMPAs or injectables. 


- The nurse suggested that if it was my first time for an implant, it might be best to start with an injectable that lasts for 3 months. Since the hormone used is the same, the side effects are most likely similar. You can do a sort of test drive with the injectable and record any side effect that you have with it. Then you can go back to the center and discuss alternatives if you feel that it's not for you. 


- Lasts for 3 years 


- Best implanted when you're menstruating so that you're sure that you're not pregnant

**How to get to Likhaan Center for Women's Health (Main Office):**


(I was coming in from the Pasig-Mandaluyong area) MRT to North EDSA. From Trinoma, ride an FX (Novaliches-SM North/Trinoma) and ask the driver to alight at Ofelia Village. Or you can also just use the Angkas app (which I used), or Grab or Uber. Just make sure to select the address as Ofelia Village. Don't select the Times address as that was their old address. I tried going there once but I couldn't find it. Only when I asked the nurse about it did I find out it no longer existed. If you're going there via Uber/Grab/Angkas or bringing your own car, the first route Waze or Google Maps usually suggests is a small minor gate almost beside Mindanao Ave. Ask instead to go through the main entrance of Ofelia Subdivision. 



They have 7 other branches such as in Navotas, San Andres (Paco, Manila). The Main Branch is open from Mondays to Fridays, 9 am to 4 pm, while their branch clinics are usually open from Tuesdays to Saturdays. Some branches specialize in counselling, while others specialize in family planning. Some of their branches will soon have ""paanakans"" or birthing clinics. The nurse and the midwife are usually at the main branch from Wednesdays to Fridays, so those are the best times to visit to get administered contraceptives such as injectables and implants. 



The exterior is a two (?)- storied white house with a brown gate. There's also a sign on the gate. When I entered, I was ushered in by a busy but friendly woman, and asked me to wait for a few minutes. Not long after, I was called by the nurse and led to the clinic. The nurse was very friendly and allowed me to ask any question I had in mind about the procedure, contraceptives, etc. 

&nbsp;

**Pre-insertion procedure:**
-  The nurse asks about your medical history and creates a medical record for you. It's highly recommended that you keep track of EVERYTHING: your last period, your BC methods such as your BC Pill intake, any symptoms that you've had when you were on your BC methods (especially if you've had spotting) If this is your first time getting any form of hormonal contraception, the nurse might ask you about the nearest approximate date of your last sexual contact. Now I know some people might be scared or worried about detailing their medical histories, but you should always be as honest as possible. Likhaan is a safe place where you can talk about it without judgement. It's very important to mention if you have heart disease, liver disease, a smoking habit, etc. Why? This is so that the nurse can give you the best recommendation possible and brief you about the possible side effect/s of the BC method you have chosen. 


-  After asking about your medical history, the nurse asks you whether you are a lefty or a righty. Since I'm right-handed, the implant would be placed on my left arm and vice versa. 

**Insertion:**

 
-  The nurse leads you to a table where you lie down while s/he gets the Implanon. 


-   You are asked to lift your arm and place your hand under your head. 


-   The nurse rubs alcohol on your skin 


-   After a few more minutes of preparation, the nurse injects you with anesthesia. NOTE: Talk to the nurse about any allergies you have with medications before proceeding. I'd have to say this was the most painful part of the procedure. The ""bite"" from the anesthesia still lingers even if the whole place is numb. It takes a few seconds (probably around a minute or two, tops) before the area becomes numb. The nurse would pinch you and ask you if you still feel the pinch. I had to be pinched a few times because I wasn't sure whether the pain was from the pinch or the anesthesia hahaha (If you're nervous about the injection for the anesthetic, do NOT drink coffee before going there like I did. щ(ಥДಥщ) ) 


- The nurse inserts the rod through a sort of stapler-like device. I felt nothing at all, save for the lingering pain from the anesthesia. 


- Right after the implant is inserted, the nurse asks you to feel the implant and shows you how to check if it's in place or not. Again, the implant doesn't usually move but if you can't feel the implant it means that it has been inserted the wrong way and wouldn't be effective. It has to be removed and reinserted properly. The nurse at the center was very proficient and professional, most likely having done this to hundreds of women so you don't have to worry at all about the implant being inserted improperly. 
- The nurse puts a Band-aid on the site of insertion, then gauze to make sure the wound doesn't get infected. 


**Post-insertion:**
-  The nurse gives you instructions in how to care for your wound. Be very careful to change your bandages on time and to make sure that your wound never gets wet!


-  S/he also advises you to abstain from sex for 7 days ಥ_ಥ but it's better to make sure that the implant is working well before you engage in unprotected sex ┌╏ º □ º ╏┐ 


-  When the anesthesia subsides, you can take mefenamic acid or paracetamol to help with the pain if it makes you feel uncomfortable. 

-  You're given a card with the date of insertion of the rod. Then, you're to go and enjoy your life as you please! o(*^▽^*)o

**Removal:** 
The card has a date when you're supposed to remove it. From what I read, it's as effective as a tubal ligation, but not permanent. To remove it, the nurse will make a small incision in your arm and remove the rod. The nurse can then replace it with a new rod but if you're aiming for a pregnancy, s/he won't replace it anymore. Fertility resumes almost immediately upon removal of the rod without any backup, meaning your period will go back to how it was before you started hormonal contraceptives. 



**IMPORTANT:**


Track everything! If you have mood swings, headaches, weight gain (though I was assured the weight gain would be at most 1 kg during the 3 years it's on.) , anything! If you are not ""hiyang"" (it isn't compatible with the way your body works), you can always go back to the Center, have it removed and discuss other contraceptive methods. As mentioned earlier, it might be best if you start out with an injectable before using the Implanon so that you have an idea if it works for you or not. Clue (https://www.helloclue.com/) is a free app available on iOS and Android, and is very easy to use to track almost everything! I always refer to it when talking to doctors about my history, and gives them a more accurate picture about symptoms and recommended medications. (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧


Likhaan also offers a myriad of contraceptives available: pills (both combination and progestin-only pills), implants (IUDs and Implanon), condoms, etc. You can ask about their other available contraceptives through their phone number. If you need it, just ask :) 


Their website and FB hasn't been updated since their transfer from Times to Ofelia, but it'll be updated very soon.

*Update*

It's been around more than 14 days and not much problems with the implant. My bruise is almost disappearing, but during the first few days of getting the implant I had to cover it up lest someone think that someone hurt me. I've noticed that even though I am proud of my decision to get one, I sometimes end up saying that I bumped my arm or had an accident to avoid telling people that I got an implant. :/ Still a but worried about being judged even though I'd shout any type of information about contraceptives as much as I can. Do you feel the same way? :( ",mojojojo31,I wish the vasagel for men becomes available here now.

dk0glfl,Finally gotten the implant birth control - Implanon,"Me and my sister went to the Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Project 8, Q.C on July 6, 2017 to get the 3-year implant for a pregnancy free life.

I am 19, sexually active and was on the pill for 3 months before finally giving up on it since I've been missing my drinking time and lost my pills (hopefully mom won't find them)

My sister, on the other hand, is 17 and has no experience on sex whatsoever; but chose to get the implant too since if she ever gets the chance to do it, she'll be safe from getting pregnant. (Not from STDs, use condoms!!)

We were pretty nervous on our way there since I was expecting a really messy center filled with mothers and children and crying babies 😂
But when we got there (we almost got lost), it was a huge office with a small signboard outside.

Pushed the doorbell and told them we were inquiring about the implants 😂
They asked if we scheduled an appointment (which made us sho0kt because that is the only time I was available).
But they called Ate Chona and she called us to follow her to the office inside the building.

There was a tidy clinic there and she asked us if we really wanted the implant and not the injections every 3 months.
When I said I really want the implant, she said okay and gave us form to fill up.

After filling up the forms, we were told to lie on the bed inside.
The process was fast, just a (painful) injection of anesthesia left for 2 minutes
Then the implant was removed from the packaging.
You won't be able to see the implant yourself since its inside of a thingy that is like a stapler stabbed in the place where she injected the anesthesia (which is not painful anymore)
She puts a band aid, then a gauze pad and wraps it with bandage then you're good to go 😊
She just signs a receipt for the removal and replacement after 3 years 😊

I can send you their contact number thru pm since I don't wanna share it in this post.
If you plan to go there, contact them first because they might not be there since they go to other places for work/community service.

The people there are friendly and if you're lazy like me, this is the best birth control for you 😊

My sister, on the other hand, is 17 and has no experience on sex whatsoever; but chose to get the implant too since if she ever gets the chance to do it, she'll be safe from getting pregnant. (Not from STDs, use condoms!!)

We were pretty nervous on our way there since I was expecting a really messy center filled with mothers and children and crying babies 😂
But when we got there (we almost got lost), it was a huge office with a small signboard outside.

Pushed the doorbell and told them we were inquiring about the implants 😂
They asked if we scheduled an appointment (which made us sho0kt because that is the only time I was available).
But they called Ate Chona and she called us to follow her to the office inside the building.

There was a tidy clinic there and she asked us if we really wanted the implant and not the injections every 3 months.
When I said I really want the implant, she said okay and gave us form to fill up.

After filling up the forms, we were told to lie on the bed inside.
The process was fast, just a (painful) injection of anesthesia left for 2 minutes
Then the implant was removed from the packaging.
You won't be able to see the implant yourself since its inside of a thingy that is like a stapler stabbed in the place where she injected the anesthesia (which is not painful anymore)
She puts a band aid, then a gauze pad and wraps it with bandage then you're good to go 😊
She just signs a receipt for the removal and replacement after 3 years 😊

I can send you their contact number thru pm since I don't wanna share it in this post.
If you plan to go there, contact them first because they might not be there since they go to other places for work/community service.

The people there are friendly and if you're lazy like me, this is the best birth control for you 😊
",nsfwnsfw300,"Congratulations to you and your sister! I feel like this is something everyone should know about.

I got one a month ago (and I'm way older, just didn't realize there was something like this for free here). I'm having complications with my period, but I'm hoping it'll clear soon. Otherwise, I'll have to have it removed and go back to using the pill, which I have no budget for rn. I'll go back to the clinic for a check up.",0,t3_6m8gye,3,r/Philippines,12,427,supporting

I am 19, sexually active and was on the pill for 3 months before finally giving up on it since I've been missing my drinking time and lost my pills (hopefully mom won't find them)

My sister, on the other hand, is 17 and has no experience on sex whatsoever; but chose to get the implant too since if she ever gets the chance to do it, she'll be safe from getting pregnant. (Not from STDs, use condoms!!)

We were pretty nervous on our way there since I was expecting a really messy center filled with mothers and children and crying babies 😂
But when we got there (we almost got lost), it was a huge office with a small signboard outside.

Pushed the doorbell and told them we were inquiring about the implants 😂
They asked if we scheduled an appointment (which made us sho0kt because that is the only time I was available).
But they called Ate Chona and she called us to follow her to the office inside the building.

There was a tidy clinic there and she asked us if we really wanted the implant and not the injections every 3 months.
When I said I really want the implant, she said okay and gave us form to fill up.

After filling up the forms, we were told to lie on the bed inside.
The process was fast, just a (painful) injection of anesthesia left for 2 minutes
Then the implant was removed from the packaging.
You won't be able to see the implant yourself since its inside of a thingy that is like a stapler stabbed in the place where she injected the anesthesia (which is not painful anymore)
She puts a band aid, then a gauze pad and wraps it with bandage then you're good to go 😊
She just signs a receipt for the removal and replacement after 3 years 😊

I can send you their contact number thru pm since I don't wanna share it in this post.
If you plan to go there, contact them first because they might not be there since they go to other places for work/community service.

The people there are friendly and if you're lazy like me, this is the best birth control for you 😊

My sister, on the other hand, is 17 and has no experience on sex whatsoever; but chose to get the implant too since if she ever gets the chance to do it, she'll be safe from getting pregnant. (Not from STDs, use condoms!!)

We were pretty nervous on our way there since I was expecting a really messy center filled with mothers and children and crying babies 😂
But when we got there (we almost got lost), it was a huge office with a small signboard outside.

Pushed the doorbell and told them we were inquiring about the implants 😂
They asked if we scheduled an appointment (which made us sho0kt because that is the only time I was available).
But they called Ate Chona and she called us to follow her to the office inside the building.

There was a tidy clinic there and she asked us if we really wanted the implant and not the injections every 3 months.
When I said I really want the implant, she said okay and gave us form to fill up.

After filling up the forms, we were told to lie on the bed inside.
The process was fast, just a (painful) injection of anesthesia left for 2 minutes
Then the implant was removed from the packaging.
You won't be able to see the implant yourself since its inside of a thingy that is like a stapler stabbed in the place where she injected the anesthesia (which is not painful anymore)
She puts a band aid, then a gauze pad and wraps it with bandage then you're good to go 😊
She just signs a receipt for the removal and replacement after 3 years 😊

I can send you their contact number thru pm since I don't wanna share it in this post.
If you plan to go there, contact them first because they might not be there since they go to other places for work/community service.

The people there are friendly and if you're lazy like me, this is the best birth control for you 😊

But they called Ate Chona and she called us to follow her to the office inside the building.

There was a tidy clinic there and she asked us if we really wanted the implant and not the injections every 3 months.
When I said I really want the implant, she said okay and gave us form to fill up.

After filling up the forms, we were told to lie on the bed inside.
The process was fast, just a (painful) injection of anesthesia left for 2 minutes
Then the implant was removed from the packaging.
You won't be able to see the implant yourself since its inside of a thingy that is like a stapler stabbed in the place where she injected the anesthesia (which is not painful anymore)
She puts a band aid, then a gauze pad and wraps it with bandage then you're good to go 😊
She just signs a receipt for the removal and replacement after 3 years 😊

",FunkeeBuncher,"From:
http://cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/politics/2017/03/31/reproductive-health.html

(quite long read so here are just excerpts)

> On June 2015, the Supreme Court released a temporary restraining order halting the distribution of contraceptive implants and prohibiting the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from “granting any and all pending applications for registration and/or recertification for reproductive products and supplies, including contraceptive drugs and devices.”

> Alliance for the Family and Foundation (ALFI) declared its opposition to a total of 77 contraceptives, taking its case to court, arguing that contraceptives had abortifacient qualities.

> The Supreme Court denied a petition to lift the TRO in 2016, directing FDA to conduct a hearing that would allow ALFI to air its grievances and present its evidence. It also ordered that the FDA and the Department of Health (DOH) come up with specific guidelines to prove these contraceptives were non-abortifacient and allow “interested parties... to intervene.”

> All this is on top of the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Law — which provides that these contraceptives be made distributable — being disputed in court.

> For its part, the executive department, through President Rodrigo Duterte — keeping to an earlier promise — has signed Executive Order No. 12, which hopes to accelerate the implementation of the Reproductive Health Law (at least, by providing for collaborations between civil society and the private sector), even as access through public agencies faces a conundrum in the judiciary.

> Still, the EO may not be enough. “The issue will be that no one will be allowed to provide any family planning methods ... whether it’s the government or the private sector or a UN agency doesn’t matter, because it’s the product registration that would be not in place,” explained Klaus Beck, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Philippine Country Representative.

> Beck describes two ways the TRO affects the public. First, although it only targets one form of contraception — the implant — it targets the go-to method for women in rural communities.

> “The implants have increasingly become the method of choice for many women because it's very convenient,” Beck says. “That's particularly important if you're living very far away from health facilities, you have limited access to health services and health supplies.”

> “Secondly, by having this TRO in place, it has sown a lot of confusion among people about what is and what is not allowed, which has meant that many healthcare providers, government units have been confused about what is covered [and what isn’t],” Beck continues.

> Commission on Population Executive Director Juan Perez III estimated that by next year, only four out of the 48 available contraceptives would be on the market, in an interview in Esquire Philippines. The same report estimated that by 2020, condoms would be the only contraceptive available.

> But Dr. Junice Melgar, founder of the Likhaan Center for Women’s Health, estimated that it would be as early as next year. Although these date estimations vary among sources, they all agree — to quote Melgar — that “there will come a time when not one contraceptive will be allowed and all women, whether rich or poor, will not have access to contraceptives.”",2,t1_dk0eqx7,3,r/Philippines,0,3381,supporting

",razzy2014,"I agree. I'm also conflicted about this thread.

On one hand, it's good when teens are pro-active in seeking information to prevent pregnancies and spread of STD. On the other, the casual attitude regarding sex/pregnancy is somewhat disturbing, especially with the mention of encouraging OP's 17yo sister to get it. 

With an older sister's two untimely pregnancies, one would think the tidbit the siblings must've taken from that would be more about the eye-opening weight of responsibility sex implies, rather than what better contraceptive should I use, knowing no contraceptive is truly foolproof.    

OP, I truly do not intend to rag on you. I guess this POV just bewilders me enough to post about it. I'm pretty sex-positive/liberal about people having sex, but am on the thinking 'abstain, or engage in sex only when you know you are capable to handle even unintended consequences' (I suppose abortion's not off the table)-- that goes for both minors *and* adults. Perhaps it's a generational thing.

I am 19, sexually active and was on the pill for 3 months before finally giving up on it since I've been missing my drinking time and lost my pills (hopefully mom won't find them)

My sister, on the other hand, is 17 and has no experience on sex whatsoever; but chose to get the implant too since if she ever gets the chance to do it, she'll be safe from getting pregnant. (Not from STDs, use condoms!!)

We were pretty nervous on our way there since I was expecting a really messy center filled with mothers and children and crying babies 😂
But when we got there (we almost got lost), it was a huge office with a small signboard outside.

Pushed the doorbell and told them we were inquiring about the implants 😂
They asked if we scheduled an appointment (which made us sho0kt because that is the only time I was available).
But they called Ate Chona and she called us to follow her to the office inside the building.

There was a tidy clinic there and she asked us if we really wanted the implant and not the injections every 3 months.
When I said I really want the implant, she said okay and gave us form to fill up.

After filling up the forms, we were told to lie on the bed inside.
The process was fast, just a (painful) injection of anesthesia left for 2 minutes
Then the implant was removed from the packaging.
You won't be able to see the implant yourself since its inside of a thingy that is like a stapler stabbed in the place where she injected the anesthesia (which is not painful anymore)
She puts a band aid, then a gauze pad and wraps it with bandage then you're good to go 😊
She just signs a receipt for the removal and replacement after 3 years 😊

I can send you their contact number thru pm since I don't wanna share it in this post.
If you plan to go there, contact them first because they might not be there since they go to other places for work/community service.

The people there are friendly and if you're lazy like me, this is the best birth control for you 😊

",impandelicious,"Also just to add, but I am sure this has been explained to you, implanon basically tricks your body into thinking that it is pregnant by releasing a hormone called progestin- so you might feel some common pregnancy symptoms. However if you take a pregnancy test it should still be a negative because those look a different hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin or hcg.

I hate that I have to explain but I really was not being sarcastic. It is a great action and I am happy you had the initiative to exercise your freedom of personal choice in a conservative country. :)",4,t1_dk0qxsc,3,r/Philippines,0,578,supporting

Unfortunately, people love to fuck mindlessly like lab bunnies without thinking of the possible consequences. They think that it's all fun and games until pregnancy knocks on their doors. And when that moment comes, they'd rather have the baby flushed out of the woman's body than take some responsibility. A few years ago, a friend of mine borrowed some cash from me for a reason he couldn't say. When finally spilled it, he told me that he used the money to get his girlfriend an abortion, who was knocked up by her ex. When I was visiting them one time (my friend and I are neighbors), there was this one time that his girlfriend was bleeding all over the toilet, and she was deathly pale. It was a horrifying sight, but they insisted not to take her to the hospital. It took her months to bounce back and recover from what happened. No one should experience that.

Most of the girls I knew had it done either in their second last year.

Edit 2: GOLD?! Is talking about birth control and reproductive health my true purpose in life?!",CrocPB,"Specially to their nether regions *owwwww!*

Where did I hear about circumcision? Or the injections? The injections were for anaesthesia (which ironically hurts like a motherf*cker).

Yep, very prevalent and well....almost pointless. Asides from you know....when your doctor recommends it.

>but parents still make their male children go through it.
Tell me about it. Add to the fact that children at that age are expected to shut up and obey means that the individual grounds for the procedure are almost not even a consideration at all.

The kids are not even asked at any point whether they want the procedure and the doctor likely doesn't talk the kid through the procedure or what happens or why it's even a procedure

It doesn't help that macho man culture is still prevalent too: you'll have your manhood insulted if you refused to undergo it from your peers.

From my personal experience: I had no idea why or what the f*ck was going on. They brought me back from the UK to have the procedure done. No questions, no GP (UK doctor) appointments. Nothing. I was feeling a little scared and I wanted to ask if I had to do the operation but I was too intimidated to do so. Once in the PH it's not like I can run away and hide can I? So off to the clinic.....and let's just say I had never felt such pain in my life before or ever since (if you want me to talk about the details I can do that too). Then the healing procedure....throbbing pains and then the scars healed.

The only way I can come to terms with this is that I was browsing Wikipedia and came across the medical condition known as [""Phimosis""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phimosis). Which I thought I had and would want to speak to a GP about. I didn't get the chance because of the circumcision (which is *one* of the ways to address it).

If I find that I develop health problems as a result of this (i.e. scars never fully healed so sex would hurt) I don't know if I can forgive anyone that coerced me into it.

What I find to be absolutely infuriating however is one of the reasons why one would have it done: apart from *proper* health reasons with certification from a medical professional and cleanliness issues (seriously, is it that hard to clean it?), one of the oft quipped reasons to have it done is.......*so that you become taller*. Apparently. I overheard my aunt say that with regards to her son (as he is reaching circumcision age) and I hope to whoever he seeks independent advice. To justify such an invasive procedure on that ground (which I honestly doubt is true) makes me boil in anger. I mean never mind I'm fairly tall circumcision had nothing to do with it. Many Filipino men have it done and most of them are still midgets (no offense)

And if I have kids and any Filipino family or relations ask me if I'm having them circumcised I don't know if I can stop myself from exploding.

Sorry for the long wall of text....I just detest the idea of circumcision and think a discussion on health in the PH is sorely lacking beyond belief.",4,t1_cp96ooo,1,r/Philippines,8,3050,supporting

Also, what are the best pills to buy for birth control and emergency contraceptives?",aallddss,"1. Best to get checked by your doctor to know what’s best for you.
2. If you’re self medicating, do lots of research. Ask your friends what type of Birth Control Pills (BCP) they use and ask how it worked for them. It really is different per body. I’ve been told BCP makes you break out but the entire time I was on it, my skin turned clear. The downside tho- I got super emotional and became the sad drunk instead of the life of the party.
3. If you don’t want to actively take the pill, you can always go for Emergency Contraception (EC). Though it isn’t available here, you can “DIY” and take 4 BCPs at the same time and take 4 more after twelve hours. Don’t do this too often unless you wanna wreck your uterus.
4. Again- just get checked if it gives you peace of mind. Though I speak from experience, I can’t reiterate it enough that it really is different for everyone.
5. I’d rather have fucked up hormones than carry a child at the moment.
6. Lady is pretty cheap (P42 pesos per 28 pills yo). Venus, afaik, go for P450-P600? Last time I bought, I was just asked if may prescription ako- lied but they sold it to me anyway.",0,t3_8jc8km,1,r/Philippines,4,1135,supporting

e53b43d,My Girlfriend's IUD Experience,"Hi r/PH!

Just want to share my GF's IUD experience to this sub.

&#x200B;

First, a little background: 

&#x200B;

We have never really considered any sort of birth control before. We were happy with the withdrawal method and have been doing fine for a year now (safe sex, i know :<). So anyway, rewind to three weeks ago i decided to use a condom cause i wanted the sensation of finishing inside. After the fact, i found out the condom broke. I was in complete panic since this was about the time my GF was in her fertile period. 

&#x200B;

After 1 full night of researching Plan Bs, emergency birth control and even abortion inducing pills, i came across the IUD. My Gf and I found Likhaan (here on Reddit lol)  and scheduled a visit to the clinic 2 days after.

&#x200B;

It's important to note that as an emergency birth control measure, an IUD is effective up to 5 days from intercourse so we were well within the window. Anyway, we went to the San Andres branch because specialists aren't always available in the QC branch. From what i've noticed, all the Likhaan Clinics are found within relatively low-income neighborhoods. I was worried she'd get scared to go cause it seems like the kind of place you'd get mugged in late at night but she pushed through with a smile on her face. The clinic itself was clean, and the staff were very very helpful and accommodating. There were only 2 other people who were there when we arrived and this was on a Saturday so i expect not a lot of people come here. the wait time was rather long, about 45 mins but the procedure itself was over and done in about 15 mins. My GF stayed in the doctor's office much longer cause she had so many questions. 

&#x200B;

It was painless, according to her. but then again she has a high tolerance for pain. Immediate effects for her was spotting and bleeding the first few days. When she got her period 3 days after it was relatively heavier than normal. the thing with my GFs cycle is that it works like clockwork at exactly 28 days. Her period this time was earlier by about 10 days and her bleeding was significantly longer, at 10 days. My GF never gets period cramps but at one point she was crying because it was hurting so much. Heavier bleeding and more painful cramps are normal side effects of this, some studies say this could last up to 6 months as the body continues to adjust. Immediately after as well, she said that she feels like a brand new woman, very much empowered feeling very much in control of her body. I can understand why though, as being part of a conservative, traditional household she doesn't get to decide much on her life. I felt like this is one of those decisions she actually made by herself, for herself. very proud!

&#x200B;

On my side naman, it feels amazing having to enjoy sex with my GF without the worry of her getting pregnant. Finish outside, finish inside, it doesn't matter. the IUD is the safest form of birth control there is. Bonus, since they use a copper IUD and not a hormonal IUD, my GF's hormones dont get fucked up so she doesnt turn into a raging hulk lol. Only downside of it is that in some positions during sex, i can feel the strings from the IUD which can get pretty painful. Imagine a a really stiff toothbrush brushing against the underside of your peen head \*yikes\* But that's a small price to pay for what almost seems like a lifetime of not worrying. 

&#x200B;

The most amazing part though is that this whole procedure is free. For the low low price of 0 fucking pesos, you can avoid accidental pregnancies for 10-12 years. Private doctors would charge as much as Php15000 for this from what i've read. The sad irony of it is that despite being free and easily accessible, unwanted teenage pregnancies are still very rampant :(. ",,Great share OP.

On my side naman, it feels amazing having to enjoy sex with my GF without the worry of her getting pregnant. Finish outside, finish inside, it doesn't matter. the IUD is the safest form of birth control there is. Bonus, since they use a copper IUD and not a hormonal IUD, my GF's hormones dont get fucked up so she doesnt turn into a raging hulk lol. Only downside of it is that in some positions during sex, i can feel the strings from the IUD which can get pretty painful. Imagine a a really stiff toothbrush brushing against the underside of your peen head \*yikes\* But that's a small price to pay for what almost seems like a lifetime of not worrying. 

&#x200B;

The most amazing part though is that this whole procedure is free. For the low low price of 0 fucking pesos, you can avoid accidental pregnancies for 10-12 years. Private doctors would charge as much as Php15000 for this from what i've read. The sad irony of it is that despite being free and easily accessible, unwanted teenage pregnancies are still very rampant :(.

Just want to share my GF's IUD experience to this sub.

&#x200B;

First, a little background: 

&#x200B;

We have never really considered any sort of birth control before. We were happy with the withdrawal method and have been doing fine for a year now (safe sex, i know :<). So anyway, rewind to three weeks ago i decided to use a condom cause i wanted the sensation of finishing inside. After the fact, i found out the condom broke. I was in complete panic since this was about the time my GF was in her fertile period. 

&#x200B;

After 1 full night of researching Plan Bs, emergency birth control and even abortion inducing pills, i came across the IUD. My Gf and I found Likhaan (here on Reddit lol)  and scheduled a visit to the clinic 2 days after.

&#x200B;

It's important to note that as an emergency birth control measure, an IUD is effective up to 5 days from intercourse so we were well within the window. Anyway, we went to the San Andres branch because specialists aren't always available in the QC branch. From what i've noticed, all the Likhaan Clinics are found within relatively low-income neighborhoods. I was worried she'd get scared to go cause it seems like the kind of place you'd get mugged in late at night but she pushed through with a smile on her face. The clinic itself was clean, and the staff were very very helpful and accommodating. There were only 2 other people who were there when we arrived and this was on a Saturday so i expect not a lot of people come here. the wait time was rather long, about 45 mins but the procedure itself was over and done in about 15 mins. My GF stayed in the doctor's office much longer cause she had so many questions. 

&#x200B;

It was painless, according to her. but then again she has a high tolerance for pain. Immediate effects for her was spotting and bleeding the first few days. When she got her period 3 days after it was relatively heavier than normal. the thing with my GFs cycle is that it works like clockwork at exactly 28 days. Her period this time was earlier by about 10 days and her bleeding was significantly longer, at 10 days. My GF never gets period cramps but at one point she was crying because it was hurting so much. Heavier bleeding and more painful cramps are normal side effects of this, some studies say this could last up to 6 months as the body continues to adjust. Immediately after as well, she said that she feels like a brand new woman, very much empowered feeling very much in control of her body. I can understand why though, as being part of a conservative, traditional household she doesn't get to decide much on her life.

Her period this time was earlier by about 10 days and her bleeding was significantly longer, at 10 days. My GF never gets period cramps but at one point she was crying because it was hurting so much. Heavier bleeding and more painful cramps are normal side effects of this, some studies say this could last up to 6 months as the body continues to adjust. Immediately after as well, she said that she feels like a brand new woman, very much empowered feeling very much in control of her body. I can understand why though, as being part of a conservative, traditional household she doesn't get to decide much on her life. I felt like this is one of those decisions she actually made by herself, for herself. very proud!

On my side naman, it feels amazing having to enjoy sex with my GF without the worry of her getting pregnant. Finish outside, finish inside, it doesn't matter. the IUD is the safest form of birth control there is. Bonus, since they use a copper IUD and not a hormonal IUD, my GF's hormones dont get fucked up so she doesnt turn into a raging hulk lol. Only downside of it is that in some positions during sex, i can feel the strings from the IUD which can get pretty painful. Imagine a a really stiff toothbrush brushing against the underside of your peen head \*yikes\* But that's a small price to pay for what almost seems like a lifetime of not worrying. 

&#x200B;

The most amazing part though is that this whole procedure is free. For the low low price of 0 fucking pesos, you can avoid accidental pregnancies for 10-12 years. Private doctors would charge as much as Php15000 for this from what i've read. The sad irony of it is that despite being free and easily accessible, unwanted teenage pregnancies are still very rampant :(.

Plan B is absolutely NOT for regular use. It seriously messes up your hormones and can make you feel like *absolute shit* for a day or two. I believe long term effects of using Plan B regularly aren’t well-known either because it absolutely wasn’t meant for regular use.

To add, contraceptives that aren’t condoms also aren’t recommended as your main form of contraception if (1) you aren’t in a steady, monogamous relationship and (2) if you and/or your partner have had previous encounters and have not been tested for HIV/HPV recently. HIV is obviously serious and needs no explanation, but HPV is a bitch too. Genital warts definitely suck, but it’s worse for women as HPV is the main cause for cervical cancer. Please get yourself HPV vaccines *before* using non-condom contraception.

To sorta answer your question, I’d actually recommend IUDs over the other options. They’re the lowest maintenance and are very reliable. Once it’s inserted, you don’t have to think about it for 10 years except for your checkups which can be done yearly. Birth control pills, although they should be 99%++ effective, highly depend on the user. Missing a pill, not taking it at the right time, taking meds that interfere with it, etc can lower that effectivity rate significantly. There are also a lot of options with birth control pills and you really need to find which dosage suit you best. Otherwise, they can have some shitty effects too like acne, mood swings, etc.",0,t3_7l7qly,7,r/Philippines,16,1507,supporting

Tbh in the long run ,the morning after pill, as effective as it was for me, it really just fucks up your whole menstruation period and not to mention the side effects are the worst. 

The first time I took it, I had fever and diarrhea for a whole week and I bled more than what I usually do when I’m on my period. After a while you get used to it and know what to expect but then again, it fucks up your menstruation cycle since it is supposed to make u bleed out. 

2 of my closest best friends have been on BCP. One has been taking it for a year and the other for 6 months, needless to say, what they say about mood swings is quite true. So if you are planning on going on it, warn your SO that you might get irritated easily along with other emotional side effects. 

Have you considered getting an IUD instead? I heard they can last for up to 3 years and it doesn’t really have any side effects and it’s quite safe as well in preventing pregnancy",0,t3_7l7qly,1,r/Philippines,8,1112,supporting

Some just cause genital warts. The virus becomes *dormant* in most people over time, but once you get it you can never truly *clear* it. Meaning it can recur and you can still pass it on when it does. Vaccines against the strain that you have aren’t effective anymore, but they will be against the ones you don’t have so it’s still a good idea to get vaccinated even if you’re already infected. But basically yeah, there’s no cure, only prevention.

Both luckily and unluckily, the strains that cause warts do not cause cervical cancer. They can remove the abnormal cells that may lead to cancer, there are also “treatments” that can remove warts, but again, they’re not 100% effective. They can recur and you’d have to go undergo the procedure again, which is expensive and painful.

There’s also some conflicting research about the effect of contraceptives on hpv and cancer. So really, it’s just best to invest in vaccines as early as possible.

Me living in a normal country where people have choice (even abortion is legal, i do not agree with abortion unless specific cases), I advise her to visit the Ob-gyn doctor. She lives in a municipality 80 kilometers from a bigger city. She goes to the hospital in the municipality and the doctor is on leave and after 12 PM no doctor is available anymore. Next normal thing to do is to ask her to go to the bigger city, which is 2 hours travel. Of course, in a 250,000 inhabitants, no Ob-gyn doctor available in that specific moment and she has to return. Thinking of what is better, I ask her to try all the pharmacies to look for Plan B (emergency contraception) pills, but all the pharmacists did not even know what Plan B means, did not even understand the words 'emergency contraception', asking her what is that. After I search a little in Google I find out that there is no such thing in the Philippines and pharmacies are not allow to sell. I wonder though what kind of school those pharmacists attend, that they do not know what ""levonorgestrel"" means, because once you give this name, they are supposed to tell you what are the drugs available containing this substance. Maybe the school they attend is 'enjoy fiesta and eating lechon baboy' ?  


  
Researching more in the internet I find some open minded filipino website describing the available birth control pills in the Philippines and which can be substituted for Plan B and I found Trust pills which cost like 50 pesos for a pack. She gets 4 pills and then after 12 hours another 4 pills and decides to stay on the pill. It was supposedly her first day of menstruation anyways. I still advised to see a doctor, she tries again in her municipality but the doctor is 'on leave'.. I did not hear such term about a doctor.  


  
Next day when she is going there at 8 AM she is sent home as there were only 15 people in a day allowed. One more day is passing and she goes there at 7.30 AM and the nurse at entrance guides her to a room where there is a midwife and the doctor. Only 2 girls waiting in front of her. She has no signal in that place and we cannot communicate. After 3 hours she exits the hospital and I ask her what happened. She says that the doctor is completely ignoring her, she is only talking to the midwife. She needs to explain her case in front of another 17 girls some of them knowing her. They even ask her to tell the name of the guy. Doctor continues to ignore her and they ask her to attend some course, about danger signs in pregnancy which she started to attend. She is only able to talk a little to the midwife which advises she will get a pregnancy test.

ep3ji8t,Shame on most doctors in the Philippines,"I would like to share here how the doctors in your country treat their own people in the worst possible way. This is one of the stories I have.  


My employee which is 19 and female had sex with her boyfriend and the condom broke. She came out to me for help. Me living in a normal country where people have choice (even abortion is legal, i do not agree with abortion unless specific cases), I advise her to visit the Ob-gyn doctor. She lives in a municipality 80 kilometers from a bigger city. She goes to the hospital in the municipality and the doctor is on leave and after 12 PM no doctor is available anymore. Next normal thing to do is to ask her to go to the bigger city, which is 2 hours travel. Of course, in a 250,000 inhabitants, no Ob-gyn doctor available in that specific moment and she has to return. Thinking of what is better, I ask her to try all the pharmacies to look for Plan B (emergency contraception) pills, but all the pharmacists did not even know what Plan B means, did not even understand the words 'emergency contraception', asking her what is that. After I search a little in Google I find out that there is no such thing in the Philippines and pharmacies are not allow to sell. I wonder though what kind of school those pharmacists attend, that they do not know what ""levonorgestrel"" means, because once you give this name, they are supposed to tell you what are the drugs available containing this substance. Maybe the school they attend is 'enjoy fiesta and eating lechon baboy' ?  


  
Researching more in the internet I find some open minded filipino website describing the available birth control pills in the Philippines and which can be substituted for Plan B and I found Trust pills which cost like 50 pesos for a pack. She gets 4 pills and then after 12 hours another 4 pills and decides to stay on the pill. It was supposedly her first day of menstruation anyways. I still advised to see a doctor, she tries again in her municipality but the doctor is 'on leave'.. I did not hear such term about a doctor.  


  
Next day when she is going there at 8 AM she is sent home as there were only 15 people in a day allowed. One more day is passing and she goes there at 7.30 AM and the nurse at entrance guides her to a room where there is a midwife and the doctor. Only 2 girls waiting in front of her. She has no signal in that place and we cannot communicate. After 3 hours she exits the hospital and I ask her what happened. She says that the doctor is completely ignoring her, she is only talking to the midwife. She needs to explain her case in front of another 17 girls some of them knowing her. They even ask her to tell the name of the guy. Doctor continues to ignore her and they ask her to attend some course, about danger signs in pregnancy which she started to attend. She is only able to talk a little to the midwife which advises she will get a pregnancy test.  


Now the big fuck up. When you become a doctor, you agree to keep the secret about the patient. You also agree that you will do your best to save his life. If you don't do this, you are NOT WORTH to be a doctor. Her case is so private and other people are not supposed to know about this but she needs to explain herself in front of other 17 women which says it shames her so much. She even had to pay 200 pesos for this. I wish I am there and I would just go inside and take her out and scream at the doctor and also go to report the scam to the police as she did not receive any checkup from the doctor for the money she paid.  


Is there any place where this can be reported ?  


Another case similar to this is when her mother has a swollen arm and they go to the big city to be attended by a doctor, even they have money, there is no way that they get to any doctor. No one is paying attention to them even in big hospitals that are newly built. One of the big hospital that has so much advertising has no doctor inside, only nurses ! For God's sake, what is happening to the doctors in the Philippines ? Where are they ? What are they ? Monsters ?

What do you want the doctor to do? Extract the semen inside her? You already said she had taken the pills already. And its not that critical of a situation for her to be given special attention to. With the lack of doctors here and probably a supply of patients with even more severe problems, i believed that the doctor is not that worried about her condition. Unless of course she showed symptoms of negative reactions to the pills. But considering you story, it doesnt seem to be the case

And for god sake its obvious that what happened was that other patients there simply ask her “hey what are you here for?” and she blabbered it herself. You really expect us to believed that a doctor would give a shit about an 18+, legal age woman for having sex? Here in Ph? Dfq?

Your posting on the say so of a 19 year old and some stories you have heard like these things are facts.

I very, very much doubt that and story you ever hear here is true and never believe a word of someone unless u see it for yourself.

Now as for DRs here, do u have any idea the dumb fucking shit they hear, see and have to put up with every single day?

Next day when she is going there at 8 AM she is sent home as there were only 15 people in a day allowed. One more day is passing and she goes there at 7.30 AM and the nurse at entrance guides her to a room where there is a midwife and the doctor. Only 2 girls waiting in front of her. She has no signal in that place and we cannot communicate. After 3 hours she exits the hospital and I ask her what happened. She says that the doctor is completely ignoring her, she is only talking to the midwife. She needs to explain her case in front of another 17 girls some of them knowing her. They even ask her to tell the name of the guy. Doctor continues to ignore her and they ask her to attend some course, about danger signs in pregnancy which she started to attend. She is only able to talk a little to the midwife which advises she will get a pregnancy test.  


Now the big fuck up. When you become a doctor, you agree to keep the secret about the patient. You also agree that you will do your best to save his life. If you don't do this, you are NOT WORTH to be a doctor. Her case is so private and other people are not supposed to know about this but she needs to explain herself in front of other 17 women which says it shames her so much. She even had to pay 200 pesos for this. I wish I am there and I would just go inside and take her out and scream at the doctor and also go to report the scam to the police as she did not receive any checkup from the doctor for the money she paid.  


Is there any place where this can be reported ?  


Another case similar to this is when her mother has a swollen arm and they go to the big city to be attended by a doctor, even they have money, there is no way that they get to any doctor. No one is paying attention to them even in big hospitals that are newly built. One of the big hospital that has so much advertising has no doctor inside, only nurses !

&#x200B;

Point 1 and 3. I know very well that abortion is illegal, i was not complaining of that at all. Doctors are nowhere to be found in a 250000 inhabitants city. So how can doctors have 10 day straight duties when they will take a break and leave going home at 12, after staying at work for 4 hours ? That is the norm in her place.  


Also I complain about the quality of these doctors. A doctor in big hospital in Manila, is giving as advice after a child had Dengue, to not eat anything that is dark colored. Any normal doctor would laugh at this advice. This advice is more like a quack doctor. I ask my doctor in my country and said that probably the doctor advising that has some mental problem.  


By the way, I almost died in the Philippines because of a simple ear infection and also almost died with dengue. I have never been so close to death as in the Philippines, twice in 3 years. Also I have never seen so many people dying around me in 3 years, as the rest of 37 years of my life. Probably 5 times more people dead in those 3 years.

The gynecologist ignored her completely. She put her to describe what she did in front of many other girls and there was no consultation at all. This is the real truth and nothing else, she is not lying to me as she really has NO REAL REASON. She is getting a lot of money from me for her hard work, I am her employer and she could not get any money if she lied about this.

Then when she was with her mother in Tacloban City, her mother had her elbow and foot swollen and having a bad allergic reaction. They are not able to find a doctor WHOLE DAY and I was on call with her when she is talking to the guards or nurses at the hospital. Not even 1 million pesos would have brought a doctor for her mother ! The staff in the hospital was unhelpful at all and many times even rude. Doctors take very much often vacations and not go to work, including dentists.

While I was in Dipolog City, I was having Dengue fever and at the hospital everyone was ignoring me. They did not even look at me. Also when I had a bad ear infection, the regular doctor which lives near prescribed me the wrong antibiotics as the ear doctor was in vacation. My ex-wife in that time forbid me (yes, forbid me, she was a fucking liar pinay, thirsty of money, controlling and very jealous) to go to another city to visit the ENT doctor and she said I could wait another 3 weeks until doctor would come back. She said practically to walk it off. I think I was lucky that the infection did not reach the brain... as I was not able to move my head in the last stage and also could barely see with my right eye. I was practically a prisoner there and had people to report to her after following me in the street watching every of my move. This is how some people think there, like her, like the idiot gynecologist or like many others that think it is fine to treat others like subhuman.

Maybe your significant other is different, but it might be the 1 % that is different. Also the one being ignored in the hospital was a pregnant mother and they just let her die, no doctor came to see her, it happened in Dipolog City, government hospital, it is not something that I heard, it was happening while I was there.

I can bet not 100 $ but I can bet 1 million that what happened is real, you just wrongly assume that everyone is a liar. If you are a liar there is no need to assume that everyone is a liar, because that is just the norm for many people there..",1,t1_ep553ls,1,r/Philippines,8,2492,supporting

Me living in a normal country where people have choice (even abortion is legal, i do not agree with abortion unless specific cases), I advise her to visit the Ob-gyn doctor. She lives in a municipality 80 kilometers from a bigger city. She goes to the hospital in the municipality and the doctor is on leave and after 12 PM no doctor is available anymore. Next normal thing to do is to ask her to go to the bigger city, which is 2 hours travel. Of course, in a 250,000 inhabitants, no Ob-gyn doctor available in that specific moment and she has to return. Thinking of what is better, I ask her to try all the pharmacies to look for Plan B (emergency contraception) pills, but all the pharmacists did not even know what Plan B means, did not even understand the words 'emergency contraception', asking her what is that. After I search a little in Google I find out that there is no such thing in the Philippines and pharmacies are not allow to sell. I wonder though what kind of school those pharmacists attend, that they do not know what ""levonorgestrel"" means, because once you give this name, they are supposed to tell you what are the drugs available containing this substance. Maybe the school they attend is 'enjoy fiesta and eating lechon baboy' ?  


  
Researching more in the internet I find some open minded filipino website describing the available birth control pills in the Philippines and which can be substituted for Plan B and I found Trust pills which cost like 50 pesos for a pack. She gets 4 pills and then after 12 hours another 4 pills and decides to stay on the pill. It was supposedly her first day of menstruation anyways. I still advised to see a doctor, she tries again in her municipality but the doctor is 'on leave'.. I did not hear such term about a doctor.  


  
Next day when she is going there at 8 AM she is sent home as there were only 15 people in a day allowed. One more day is passing and she goes there at 7.30 AM and the nurse at entrance guides her to a room where there is a midwife and the doctor. Only 2 girls waiting in front of her. She has no signal in that place and we cannot communicate. After 3 hours she exits the hospital and I ask her what happened. She says that the doctor is completely ignoring her, she is only talking to the midwife. She needs to explain her case in front of another 17 girls some of them knowing her. They even ask her to tell the name of the guy. Doctor continues to ignore her and they ask her to attend some course, about danger signs in pregnancy which she started to attend. She is only able to talk a little to the midwife which advises she will get a pregnancy test.  


Now the big fuck up. When you become a doctor, you agree to keep the secret about the patient. You also agree that you will do your best to save his life. If you don't do this, you are NOT WORTH to be a doctor. Her case is so private and other people are not supposed to know about this but she needs to explain herself in front of other 17 women which says it shames her so much. She even had to pay 200 pesos for this. I wish I am there and I would just go inside and take her out and scream at the doctor and also go to report the scam to the police as she did not receive any checkup from the doctor for the money she paid.  


Is there any place where this can be reported ?  


Another case similar to this is when her mother has a swollen arm and they go to the big city to be attended by a doctor, even they have money, there is no way that they get to any doctor. No one is paying attention to them even in big hospitals that are newly built. One of the big hospital that has so much advertising has no doctor inside, only nurses ! For God's sake, what is happening to the doctors in the Philippines ? Where are they ? What are they ? Monsters ?  


Another bad story is when someone is sick and they are not admitted in the hospital unless they will prove having enough money, like 20000 php at least. He is left to die at the gate of the hospital and of course he died. SHAME ON YOU PIECES OF SHIT THAT YOU DO THAT. Even in Africa you will be admitted if you have an emergency.  


This is all I had to say. I hope the young people that want to become a doctor will see this and act accordingly when they become doctors.",Seriously3333,"As for blind to what is happening around me.

Firstly if you live in but fuck no where then yes medical care is going to be sub par.  Every single local knows that if you want good medical care you need to go to larger cities.

This is a fact in any 3rd world country and even more so with the disaster that leyte still has not recovered from to this day.

When you go to Hospital here you need to bring a local with you.  This is what ever locals do as there is a lot of running around that needs to be done and the sick can not do it, this is how things are here.

The public hospitals in this country are under staffed, over run and under funded. 

As a Foreigner you go to a private hospital, PERIOD.

Partly because you will get better service and mostly so you do not add to the already over worked under manned public hospitals.

If you want better medical treatment then move to a larger city. 
Diplog city is a 3rd class city. with just over 100 thousand people living in it. This means it is a small ass city that is probably not used to dealing with foreigners.

Now as for vacations.  DR's deserve vacations and get about 4 weeks worth a year.  Is it their fault you went there while they were on vacation?

Is it a Dr's fault there is not enough Drs, or staff to accommodate you in a public hospital? 

I am just giving you a heads up on someone that has been here for a very long time, both in the province and out of it and all your complaints stem from being in rural areas.

When I was having Dengue I was presenting myself to a private hospital at the emergency room. Doctors are there but ignoring me for a long time and having no one to attend to. There is nothing that the local is supposed to solve. I can still walk and talk but I was being ignored. They all talk English there, no need for a local.
You do not get this thing about doctors. There are doctors in the hospitals but mostly ignoring the patients. There are doctors in emergency unit but they are ignoring the ones coming there.
Piss off with those vacations. They don't seem to get 4 weeks of vacation, they seem to get more like 5 months a year.

You get hooked to an IV for hydration and just observed. You get paracetamol perhaps for your fever. Then nothing. You just stay there so if you start to bleed they can help you. :) The doctors probably had more urgent things to attend to. Someone has mentioned triage earlier. They are not ignoring people. They are giving attention to the people who need it more.

Let me explain it you.

Three patients come in, all from a vehicular accident.
A has a broken arm. B looks fine but has a big scratch on the arm. C is bleeding profusely.

They all come at the same time but the doctors will attend C first.

The doctor, who was looking at D at the time, who had a complaint of fever, will also excuse himself from attending D and rush to help C.",4,t1_eq93n8c,1,r/Philippines,8,811,supporting

e5uivr6,I feel empowered - My IUD Experience,"Today, I made a life-changing decision of my life. I finally decided to go to Likhaan Center for Women's Health Inc at San Andres, Manila to get a Copper IUD. I learned about this through you guys in Reddit and I won't lie but the posts about IUD really gave me courage to go and get one for myself. I was accompanied by my boyfriend and we traveled from Laguna to Manila. The commute was difficult as we were both unfamiliar with the place but luckily travel apps helped us. 

Before we went to Likhaan San Andres, I called to make sure that there is someone to do the procedure. They said can accommodate me but I have to make sure that I won't come there later than 4pm. We traveled and got there at 12:30 pm. We waited for about 30 minutes as they were on lunch break. This gave me ample time to gather all the courage I can get. I am very nervous to be honest. Luckily, my boyfriend was there to keep me calm.

THE PLACE - The road leading to Likhaan San Andres Branch is under construction and the locals helped us cross the cracked roads. You will know that you are on the right place because outside, there is a tarpaulin present bearing the name of the clinic. We went inside and the place is full of informative posters. We were greeted by the front desk and ask me to sign in their logbook. After 15 minutes, I was asked to step on the weighing scale. We waited again for 15 minutes but was kept busy watching TV showing all types of birth control and I must say, this also helped me calm down.

THE PRE- IUD PROCEDURE - I was finally called to enter the room. There, I met Nurse Merlyn. She is a registered nurse. She asked me what I want and I said IUD but my options are open. She explained me all types of contraceptives that they have. I asked a lot of questions about the risks of IUD and she said that they are minimum as long as I regularly go there for check-up. I finally gave my go signal and she asked me questions (history taking) then she told me to remove my pants and undies and wear a labgown. She asked me if I want to be accompanied by my boyfriend and I said yes. I was very honest to tell to Nurse Merlyn I am very nervous and she assured me that it won't hurt. I lie down the bed and held my boyfriend's hand. As a microbiologist myself, I can attest that the instruments used were sterilized and the copper IUD was brand new. 

THE IUD PROCEDURE - Nurse Merlyn informed me that the speculum will be inserted in me and it won't hurt. BUT DAMN GURL, it fricking hurts. I whined but she assured me that this is normal as I am not menstruating (it is better to insert an IUD during your menstrual period as the cervix is open). I think I broke my boyfriend's hand as I held it really hard because it hurts. I can't seem to calm down but I forced myself because I want this. I took a deep breaths and relaxed. Nurse Merlyn was saying something but I can't comprehend it as I was too focused keeping myself calm and relaxed. And before I knew it, she said that the IUD was inserted. I was very surprised that I laughed. Boyfriend was grinning and told me he was proud of me. The last thing to do was to cut the string. THIS DAMN HURT, I reverted back to tensing my muscles but she said that this was the last procedure and it was done. I calmed down because she said she was having a hard time working with me tensing my muscles. My advice? KEEP CALM AND RELAX. During the whole procedure, I wanted to cuss but restrained myself. The procedure was very fast, I think about 10 minutes?

THE POST IUD PROCEDURE - Nurse Merlyn cleaned me up and asked me how I feel. I told her that I feel bloated and my lower abdomen feels heavy. She said that this is normal. I can't get up right away and I stayed in bed for about 5 minutes. She keep on asking how I feel and gave two tablets of ibuprofen. I asked when my boyfriend and I can have intercourse, she said give it two days before doing something. We thanked her and went home.

During our travel back home, I was uncomfortable. It felt like I was having dysmenorrhea. But aside the pain, I feel like I am empowered. I feel that I am in control. I feel strong. I don't know why but I feel these. Boyfriend is proud and I feel like crying. I am extremely happy.

e5u6lk2,I feel empowered - My IUD Experience,"Today, I made a life-changing decision of my life. I finally decided to go to Likhaan Center for Women's Health Inc at San Andres, Manila to get a Copper IUD. I learned about this through you guys in Reddit and I won't lie but the posts about IUD really gave me courage to go and get one for myself. I was accompanied by my boyfriend and we traveled from Laguna to Manila. The commute was difficult as we were both unfamiliar with the place but luckily travel apps helped us. 

Before we went to Likhaan San Andres, I called to make sure that there is someone to do the procedure. They said can accommodate me but I have to make sure that I won't come there later than 4pm. We traveled and got there at 12:30 pm. We waited for about 30 minutes as they were on lunch break. This gave me ample time to gather all the courage I can get. I am very nervous to be honest. Luckily, my boyfriend was there to keep me calm.

THE PLACE - The road leading to Likhaan San Andres Branch is under construction and the locals helped us cross the cracked roads. You will know that you are on the right place because outside, there is a tarpaulin present bearing the name of the clinic. We went inside and the place is full of informative posters.

TLDR: I finally got copper IUD at Likhaan Center San Andres Branch and I feel empowered.",calacatia,"I also got my birth control from Likhaan! I was debating between the IUD and the arm implant but ultimately went with the arm implant while researching kasi I feel I have a low cervix and use a menstrual cup. Those two things might not go well with IUDs.

Ate Chona (also from Likhaan) also recommended the arm implant nalang so here we are. I’m still in the six-month adjustment period and the irregular periods (which is made easier by the cup) and moderate acne (I’ve had acne all my life so hindi siya news) are easier to handle than a pregnancy. 

My SO also went with me sa procedure kahit na takot siya sa needles and things being injected into the skin (he still doesn’t like touching the implant area lol). Supportive SOs are great. Ate Chona also said na dapat talaga kasama ang partner para makita nila hirap na kelangan daanan ng babae para lang hindi mabuntis haha tutal kasali din naman sila sa fun part.

e5umxhf,I feel empowered - My IUD Experience,"Today, I made a life-changing decision of my life. I finally decided to go to Likhaan Center for Women's Health Inc at San Andres, Manila to get a Copper IUD. I learned about this through you guys in Reddit and I won't lie but the posts about IUD really gave me courage to go and get one for myself. I was accompanied by my boyfriend and we traveled from Laguna to Manila. The commute was difficult as we were both unfamiliar with the place but luckily travel apps helped us. 

Before we went to Likhaan San Andres, I called to make sure that there is someone to do the procedure. They said can accommodate me but I have to make sure that I won't come there later than 4pm. We traveled and got there at 12:30 pm. We waited for about 30 minutes as they were on lunch break. This gave me ample time to gather all the courage I can get. I am very nervous to be honest. Luckily, my boyfriend was there to keep me calm.

THE PLACE - The road leading to Likhaan San Andres Branch is under construction and the locals helped us cross the cracked roads. You will know that you are on the right place because outside, there is a tarpaulin present bearing the name of the clinic. We went inside and the place is full of informative posters. We were greeted by the front desk and ask me to sign in their logbook. After 15 minutes, I was asked to step on the weighing scale. We waited again for 15 minutes but was kept busy watching TV showing all types of birth control and I must say, this also helped me calm down.

THE PRE- IUD PROCEDURE - I was finally called to enter the room. There, I met Nurse Merlyn. She is a registered nurse. She asked me what I want and I said IUD but my options are open. She explained me all types of contraceptives that they have. I asked a lot of questions about the risks of IUD and she said that they are minimum as long as I regularly go there for check-up. I finally gave my go signal and she asked me questions (history taking) then she told me to remove my pants and undies and wear a labgown. She asked me if I want to be accompanied by my boyfriend and I said yes. I was very honest to tell to Nurse Merlyn I am very nervous and she assured me that it won't hurt. I lie down the bed and held my boyfriend's hand. As a microbiologist myself, I can attest that the instruments used were sterilized and the copper IUD was brand new. 

THE IUD PROCEDURE - Nurse Merlyn informed me that the speculum will be inserted in me and it won't hurt. BUT DAMN GURL, it fricking hurts. I whined but she assured me that this is normal as I am not menstruating (it is better to insert an IUD during your menstrual period as the cervix is open). I think I broke my boyfriend's hand as I held it really hard because it hurts. I can't seem to calm down but I forced myself because I want this. I took a deep breaths and relaxed. Nurse Merlyn was saying something but I can't comprehend it as I was too focused keeping myself calm and relaxed. And before I knew it, she said that the IUD was inserted. I was very surprised that I laughed. Boyfriend was grinning and told me he was proud of me. The last thing to do was to cut the string. THIS DAMN HURT, I reverted back to tensing my muscles but she said that this was the last procedure and it was done. I calmed down because she said she was having a hard time working with me tensing my muscles. My advice? KEEP CALM AND RELAX. During the whole procedure, I wanted to cuss but restrained myself. The procedure was very fast, I think about 10 minutes?

THE POST IUD PROCEDURE - Nurse Merlyn cleaned me up and asked me how I feel. I told her that I feel bloated and my lower abdomen feels heavy. She said that this is normal. I can't get up right away and I stayed in bed for about 5 minutes. She keep on asking how I feel and gave two tablets of ibuprofen. I asked when my boyfriend and I can have intercourse, she said give it two days before doing something. We thanked her and went home.

During our travel back home, I was uncomfortable. It felt like I was having dysmenorrhea. But aside the pain, I feel like I am empowered. I feel that I am in control. I feel strong. I don't know why but I feel these. Boyfriend is proud and I feel like crying. I am extremely happy.

During our travel back home, I was uncomfortable. It felt like I was having dysmenorrhea. But aside the pain, I feel like I am empowered. I feel that I am in control. I feel strong. I don't know why but I feel these. Boyfriend is proud and I feel like crying. I am extremely happy.

e5uxmbl,I feel empowered - My IUD Experience,"Today, I made a life-changing decision of my life. I finally decided to go to Likhaan Center for Women's Health Inc at San Andres, Manila to get a Copper IUD. I learned about this through you guys in Reddit and I won't lie but the posts about IUD really gave me courage to go and get one for myself. I was accompanied by my boyfriend and we traveled from Laguna to Manila. The commute was difficult as we were both unfamiliar with the place but luckily travel apps helped us. 

Before we went to Likhaan San Andres, I called to make sure that there is someone to do the procedure. They said can accommodate me but I have to make sure that I won't come there later than 4pm. We traveled and got there at 12:30 pm. We waited for about 30 minutes as they were on lunch break. This gave me ample time to gather all the courage I can get. I am very nervous to be honest. Luckily, my boyfriend was there to keep me calm.

THE PLACE - The road leading to Likhaan San Andres Branch is under construction and the locals helped us cross the cracked roads. You will know that you are on the right place because outside, there is a tarpaulin present bearing the name of the clinic. We went inside and the place is full of informative posters. We were greeted by the front desk and ask me to sign in their logbook. After 15 minutes, I was asked to step on the weighing scale. We waited again for 15 minutes but was kept busy watching TV showing all types of birth control and I must say, this also helped me calm down.

THE PRE- IUD PROCEDURE - I was finally called to enter the room. There, I met Nurse Merlyn. She is a registered nurse. She asked me what I want and I said IUD but my options are open. She explained me all types of contraceptives that they have. I asked a lot of questions about the risks of IUD and she said that they are minimum as long as I regularly go there for check-up. I finally gave my go signal and she asked me questions (history taking) then she told me to remove my pants and undies and wear a labgown. She asked me if I want to be accompanied by my boyfriend and I said yes. I was very honest to tell to Nurse Merlyn I am very nervous and she assured me that it won't hurt. I lie down the bed and held my boyfriend's hand. As a microbiologist myself, I can attest that the instruments used were sterilized and the copper IUD was brand new. 

THE IUD PROCEDURE - Nurse Merlyn informed me that the speculum will be inserted in me and it won't hurt. BUT DAMN GURL, it fricking hurts. I whined but she assured me that this is normal as I am not menstruating (it is better to insert an IUD during your menstrual period as the cervix is open). I think I broke my boyfriend's hand as I held it really hard because it hurts. I can't seem to calm down but I forced myself because I want this. I took a deep breaths and relaxed. Nurse Merlyn was saying something but I can't comprehend it as I was too focused keeping myself calm and relaxed. And before I knew it, she said that the IUD was inserted. I was very surprised that I laughed. Boyfriend was grinning and told me he was proud of me. The last thing to do was to cut the string. THIS DAMN HURT, I reverted back to tensing my muscles but she said that this was the last procedure and it was done. I calmed down because she said she was having a hard time working with me tensing my muscles. My advice? KEEP CALM AND RELAX. During the whole procedure, I wanted to cuss but restrained myself. The procedure was very fast, I think about 10 minutes?

THE POST IUD PROCEDURE - Nurse Merlyn cleaned me up and asked me how I feel. I told her that I feel bloated and my lower abdomen feels heavy. She said that this is normal. I can't get up right away and I stayed in bed for about 5 minutes. She keep on asking how I feel and gave two tablets of ibuprofen. I asked when my boyfriend and I can have intercourse, she said give it two days before doing something. We thanked her and went home.

During our travel back home, I was uncomfortable. It felt like I was having dysmenorrhea. But aside the pain, I feel like I am empowered. I feel that I am in control. I feel strong. I don't know why but I feel these. Boyfriend is proud and I feel like crying. I am extremely happy.

e5u6qei,I feel empowered - My IUD Experience,"Today, I made a life-changing decision of my life. I finally decided to go to Likhaan Center for Women's Health Inc at San Andres, Manila to get a Copper IUD. I learned about this through you guys in Reddit and I won't lie but the posts about IUD really gave me courage to go and get one for myself. I was accompanied by my boyfriend and we traveled from Laguna to Manila. The commute was difficult as we were both unfamiliar with the place but luckily travel apps helped us. 

Before we went to Likhaan San Andres, I called to make sure that there is someone to do the procedure. They said can accommodate me but I have to make sure that I won't come there later than 4pm. We traveled and got there at 12:30 pm. We waited for about 30 minutes as they were on lunch break. This gave me ample time to gather all the courage I can get. I am very nervous to be honest. Luckily, my boyfriend was there to keep me calm.

THE PLACE - The road leading to Likhaan San Andres Branch is under construction and the locals helped us cross the cracked roads. You will know that you are on the right place because outside, there is a tarpaulin present bearing the name of the clinic. We went inside and the place is full of informative posters. We were greeted by the front desk and ask me to sign in their logbook. After 15 minutes, I was asked to step on the weighing scale. We waited again for 15 minutes but was kept busy watching TV showing all types of birth control and I must say, this also helped me calm down.

THE PRE- IUD PROCEDURE - I was finally called to enter the room. There, I met Nurse Merlyn. She is a registered nurse. She asked me what I want and I said IUD but my options are open. She explained me all types of contraceptives that they have. I asked a lot of questions about the risks of IUD and she said that they are minimum as long as I regularly go there for check-up. I finally gave my go signal and she asked me questions (history taking) then she told me to remove my pants and undies and wear a labgown. She asked me if I want to be accompanied by my boyfriend and I said yes. I was very honest to tell to Nurse Merlyn I am very nervous and she assured me that it won't hurt. I lie down the bed and held my boyfriend's hand. As a microbiologist myself, I can attest that the instruments used were sterilized and the copper IUD was brand new. 

THE IUD PROCEDURE - Nurse Merlyn informed me that the speculum will be inserted in me and it won't hurt. BUT DAMN GURL, it fricking hurts. I whined but she assured me that this is normal as I am not menstruating (it is better to insert an IUD during your menstrual period as the cervix is open). I think I broke my boyfriend's hand as I held it really hard because it hurts. I can't seem to calm down but I forced myself because I want this. I took a deep breaths and relaxed. Nurse Merlyn was saying something but I can't comprehend it as I was too focused keeping myself calm and relaxed. And before I knew it, she said that the IUD was inserted. I was very surprised that I laughed. Boyfriend was grinning and told me he was proud of me. The last thing to do was to cut the string. THIS DAMN HURT, I reverted back to tensing my muscles but she said that this was the last procedure and it was done. I calmed down because she said she was having a hard time working with me tensing my muscles. My advice? KEEP CALM AND RELAX. During the whole procedure, I wanted to cuss but restrained myself. The procedure was very fast, I think about 10 minutes?

THE POST IUD PROCEDURE - Nurse Merlyn cleaned me up and asked me how I feel. I told her that I feel bloated and my lower abdomen feels heavy. She said that this is normal. I can't get up right away and I stayed in bed for about 5 minutes. She keep on asking how I feel and gave two tablets of ibuprofen. I asked when my boyfriend and I can have intercourse, she said give it two days before doing something. We thanked her and went home.

During our travel back home, I was uncomfortable. It felt like I was having dysmenorrhea. But aside the pain, I feel like I am empowered. I feel that I am in control. I feel strong. I don't know why but I feel these. Boyfriend is proud and I feel like crying. I am extremely happy.

I calmed down because she said she was having a hard time working with me tensing my muscles. My advice? KEEP CALM AND RELAX. During the whole procedure, I wanted to cuss but restrained myself. The procedure was very fast, I think about 10 minutes?

THE POST IUD PROCEDURE - Nurse Merlyn cleaned me up and asked me how I feel. I told her that I feel bloated and my lower abdomen feels heavy. She said that this is normal. I can't get up right away and I stayed in bed for about 5 minutes. She keep on asking how I feel and gave two tablets of ibuprofen. I asked when my boyfriend and I can have intercourse, she said give it two days before doing something. We thanked her and went home.

During our travel back home, I was uncomfortable. It felt like I was having dysmenorrhea. But aside the pain, I feel like I am empowered. I feel that I am in control. I feel strong. I don't know why but I feel these. Boyfriend is proud and I feel like crying. I am extremely happy.

After eating, I took 200 mg ibuprofen. The pain ease and leveled at 4. Then after taking a good bath, the pain is at 1 in which I just feel numbing around my lower abdomen. At this moment, which is 6 hours after taking the medicine, it is now back at 4. I really do not want to get up and move a lot that kind of feeling. ",1,t1_e5udtat,1,r/Philippines,4,527,supporting
e5uiru2,I feel empowered - My IUD Experience,"Today, I made a life-changing decision of my life. I finally decided to go to Likhaan Center for Women's Health Inc at San Andres, Manila to get a Copper IUD. I learned about this through you guys in Reddit and I won't lie but the posts about IUD really gave me courage to go and get one for myself. I was accompanied by my boyfriend and we traveled from Laguna to Manila. The commute was difficult as we were both unfamiliar with the place but luckily travel apps helped us. 

Before we went to Likhaan San Andres, I called to make sure that there is someone to do the procedure. They said can accommodate me but I have to make sure that I won't come there later than 4pm. We traveled and got there at 12:30 pm. We waited for about 30 minutes as they were on lunch break. This gave me ample time to gather all the courage I can get. I am very nervous to be honest. Luckily, my boyfriend was there to keep me calm.

THE PLACE - The road leading to Likhaan San Andres Branch is under construction and the locals helped us cross the cracked roads. You will know that you are on the right place because outside, there is a tarpaulin present bearing the name of the clinic. We went inside and the place is full of informative posters. We were greeted by the front desk and ask me to sign in their logbook. After 15 minutes, I was asked to step on the weighing scale. We waited again for 15 minutes but was kept busy watching TV showing all types of birth control and I must say, this also helped me calm down.

THE PRE- IUD PROCEDURE - I was finally called to enter the room. There, I met Nurse Merlyn. She is a registered nurse. She asked me what I want and I said IUD but my options are open. She explained me all types of contraceptives that they have. I asked a lot of questions about the risks of IUD and she said that they are minimum as long as I regularly go there for check-up. I finally gave my go signal and she asked me questions (history taking) then she told me to remove my pants and undies and wear a labgown. She asked me if I want to be accompanied by my boyfriend and I said yes. I was very honest to tell to Nurse Merlyn I am very nervous and she assured me that it won't hurt. I lie down the bed and held my boyfriend's hand. As a microbiologist myself, I can attest that the instruments used were sterilized and the copper IUD was brand new. 

THE IUD PROCEDURE - Nurse Merlyn informed me that the speculum will be inserted in me and it won't hurt. BUT DAMN GURL, it fricking hurts. I whined but she assured me that this is normal as I am not menstruating (it is better to insert an IUD during your menstrual period as the cervix is open). I think I broke my boyfriend's hand as I held it really hard because it hurts. I can't seem to calm down but I forced myself because I want this. I took a deep breaths and relaxed. Nurse Merlyn was saying something but I can't comprehend it as I was too focused keeping myself calm and relaxed. And before I knew it, she said that the IUD was inserted.

She asked me if I want to be accompanied by my boyfriend and I said yes. I was very honest to tell to Nurse Merlyn I am very nervous and she assured me that it won't hurt. I lie down the bed and held my boyfriend's hand. As a microbiologist myself, I can attest that the instruments used were sterilized and the copper IUD was brand new. 

THE IUD PROCEDURE - Nurse Merlyn informed me that the speculum will be inserted in me and it won't hurt. BUT DAMN GURL, it fricking hurts. I whined but she assured me that this is normal as I am not menstruating (it is better to insert an IUD during your menstrual period as the cervix is open). I think I broke my boyfriend's hand as I held it really hard because it hurts. I can't seem to calm down but I forced myself because I want this. I took a deep breaths and relaxed. Nurse Merlyn was saying something but I can't comprehend it as I was too focused keeping myself calm and relaxed. And before I knew it, she said that the IUD was inserted. I was very surprised that I laughed. Boyfriend was grinning and told me he was proud of me. The last thing to do was to cut the string. THIS DAMN HURT, I reverted back to tensing my muscles but she said that this was the last procedure and it was done. I calmed down because she said she was having a hard time working with me tensing my muscles. My advice? KEEP CALM AND RELAX. During the whole procedure, I wanted to cuss but restrained myself. The procedure was very fast, I think about 10 minutes?

THE POST IUD PROCEDURE - Nurse Merlyn cleaned me up and asked me how I feel. I told her that I feel bloated and my lower abdomen feels heavy. She said that this is normal. I can't get up right away and I stayed in bed for about 5 minutes. She keep on asking how I feel and gave two tablets of ibuprofen. I asked when my boyfriend and I can have intercourse, she said give it two days before doing something. We thanked her and went home.

During our travel back home, I was uncomfortable. It felt like I was having dysmenorrhea. But aside the pain, I feel like I am empowered. I feel that I am in control. I feel strong. I don't know why but I feel these. Boyfriend is proud and I feel like crying. I am extremely happy.

e5u72gy,I feel empowered - My IUD Experience,"Today, I made a life-changing decision of my life. I finally decided to go to Likhaan Center for Women's Health Inc at San Andres, Manila to get a Copper IUD. I learned about this through you guys in Reddit and I won't lie but the posts about IUD really gave me courage to go and get one for myself. I was accompanied by my boyfriend and we traveled from Laguna to Manila. The commute was difficult as we were both unfamiliar with the place but luckily travel apps helped us. 

Before we went to Likhaan San Andres, I called to make sure that there is someone to do the procedure. They said can accommodate me but I have to make sure that I won't come there later than 4pm. We traveled and got there at 12:30 pm. We waited for about 30 minutes as they were on lunch break. This gave me ample time to gather all the courage I can get. I am very nervous to be honest. Luckily, my boyfriend was there to keep me calm.

THE PLACE - The road leading to Likhaan San Andres Branch is under construction and the locals helped us cross the cracked roads. You will know that you are on the right place because outside, there is a tarpaulin present bearing the name of the clinic. We went inside and the place is full of informative posters. We were greeted by the front desk and ask me to sign in their logbook. After 15 minutes, I was asked to step on the weighing scale. We waited again for 15 minutes but was kept busy watching TV showing all types of birth control and I must say, this also helped me calm down.

THE PRE- IUD PROCEDURE - I was finally called to enter the room. There, I met Nurse Merlyn. She is a registered nurse. She asked me what I want and I said IUD but my options are open. She explained me all types of contraceptives that they have. I asked a lot of questions about the risks of IUD and she said that they are minimum as long as I regularly go there for check-up.

So ano na? when will this end?",gradenko_2000,"Even if we took Thanos's plan seriously for a moment, it was never going to work because:

A. if the problem is the distribution of a limited amount of resources, then obviously some people own a lot more resources than others, so deleting half of the entire population is going to include a lot of people who were never contributing to the issue in the first place.

B. even after you did it, if you make no other changes to society, then the problem is going to repeat itself, because you didn't address the root cause of why the distribution of resources is so skewed and uneven in the first place. At some point, the pyramid builds itself back up again.

\___

Now, going back to the question of ""overpopulation"", the same principle applies: the people most often blamed for causing overpopulation are also the people who are already the poorest of the country - they're not really consuming very many resources... because they're so poor, so they're hardly the problem.

And even if you had some kind of magical effect that completely arrested everyone's capability to reproduce after a second child, those people would still be as poor as ever.

""Overpopulation"" is largely an excuse to rationalize not doing anything else to solve poverty, because anything else would require _Wealth Redistribution_, and the people who are already wealthy obviously want nothing of the sort to happen.

\___

Or to put another way: if you really wanted to get people to stop fucking, then you need to give them better economic opportunities. The birth rate plummets in any country where people start getting educated, and whenever unemployment is low, and specifically as soon as women are given the chance to enter the labor force.

Of course, that would require large investments into public education, large investments into job creation, and large investments into social programs to get people out of the ditch of deep poverty. 

But then people don't want to pay for it, and sometimes the very reason used to justify wanting to avoid investing into social programs is because there's too many people to care of... because there is overpopulation! And then the whole conversation dead-ends and we're right back to talking about eugenics programs and contraceptives.",0,t3_bv8lfl,2,r/Philippines,4,2281,supporting

eoo8zfe,I remember the RH Bill issue and talk in Catholic School,"Back then when RH bill was a controversy, there's been a talk from teachers and some priests about RH bill.

Their topics: 

Free condoms from medical centers; their argument is that you can't feed your children with rubber balloons. Obviously it's a dick move on giving only condoms to a homeless mother with kids.

Contraceptives = against life; if you were caught having a condom on your wallet, it's a guarantee that they'll confiscate it, even if it's a lucky charm. Birth control pills? School says it's poison.

RH Bill includes abortion; I've seen a lot of video about the process of abortion, some have narrations and heartbeat sfx. I read the news about it to confirm and it doesn't include abortion. I told it to a theology teacher and he really thinks that it includes abortion. I can't prove it since phones aren't allowed in school.

Teenage pregnancy; As a class that are all boys, jokes are made that my classmate is going to seduce one of the pregnant teen. I don't remember the place but it's a place where pregnant teenagers stay. I assume they were discriminated and the place was asylum-esque.

Sex ed; The teacher said that we don't need sex ed. Their alternative was abstinence. The student who brought a condom was somehow wiser than the teacher.",Wolfez02,as a catholic i find it ironic that the most “effective” way of birth control for them is abstinence (never mind other factors like THERE WILL ALWAYS be other people who want to have sex regardless) when one of the core doctrines is the virginity of Mary and her pregnancy via the Holy Spirit,0,t3_bsi7p7,6,r/Philippines,0,292,supporting

> Implanon is the most effective reversible method of contraception available. It is more than 99.9% effective.

How does it work?
> It stops the body from releasing an ovum (egg) each month.
It thickens the mucus in the cervix (the entrance to the womb), which blocks sperm.

Ive only taken BCP for non pregnancy related issues. Mine was for derma issues and BCP helps with that.   You really need to talk to a doctor to recommend the right BCP for you, they will base it off your medical history & body cycle.   If you are unsure, talk to the nurses sa St. Lukes for a recommendation. They know the docs best.

Websites also like Practo and Yelp does reviews for clinics so look that up.

dsj9bsu,Copper IUD Insertion Manila,"Hi!

I got my copper IUD (Paragard) inserted today at Likhaan Center in QC. I'm done with hormonal contraception because it wasn't a good fit for me (migraines, anxiety, mood swings, etc) so I opted for the Paragard.

The process was fairly straightforward. I was asked my medical and gynecological history before insertion.

During the process, the clinician will ask you to disrobe and wear a gown. You will then be asked to lie on the table in dorsal lithotomy position (legs spread) and then an internal exam of your pelvis and vagina will be done to assess the location of your cervix and tilt of your uterus. 

After the pelvic exam, the insertion of the IUD begins. To make sure the IUD fits properly, they take a speculum to visualize your cervix then they measure where the top or fundus of your uterus is using a probe. For me, this was the most painful part (pain scale: 7-8/10). It felt really crampy but bearable - pain lasted about 10-20 seconds. 

After measuring, the IUD is inserted. This part felt like a poke and was not as painful as the measuring part (pain scale: 4-5/10). After the IUD was inserted (took less than 5 min), the strings of the IUD were cut to 3cm. 

Overall, the entire process was hygienic, fast, and not as painful as I thought. 

I recommend this form of contraception if you want a non-hormonal form of birth control. 

I took an Uber to and from the procedure. There were minimal cramping and spotting for a few hours (pain scale: 2-3/10). I took 200mg ibuprofen after the procedure and the cramps stopped after a few hours.

Overall, the experience was a pleasant one. But most of all, it was free and it lasts up to 10 years!

Highly recommend this. Will update in a month for any side effects, etc. Will also get checked via ultrasound and pelvic exam to see if the IUD is in its proper place a month from now. 

Each woman is different so reactions can vary. I'm lucky my experience was a good one :)",emoxion,"Likhaan is just a wonderful organization.

All of the people I know who are pregnant aren't even married yet, which says a lot on our current topic. In my honest opinion, I don't think most of the people even know that birth control pills exist. Even some guys think that going in defenseless is okay as long as you don't shoot it inside. Now look at them, they're pregnant at a ripe age of 18 with a person they don't even know if they'll be by their side for the rest of their lives.

The problem probably lies in our education system. I still remember being through ""sex education"" in high school, they only gave like two classes for it and afterwards they changed the topic. I would have liked them to instill fear into our minds when we were at that age, the only thing they did was tell us that condom usage is a must for preventing diseases and unwanted pregnancies. Same for the B-pills, of course. The topic didn't really do shit because the only thing our young minds thought about was how lewd the current topic was.

I believe that they should have showed as the effects of diseases and unwanted pregnancies in the lives of the people. Showing us people in the kalye with multiple children and their poverty filled lives, families breaking apart because of unwanted kids, or people dying of diseases caused by intercourse.

I got on contraception (BC pills) waaay before becoming sexually active. I did it to ease my anxiety (I'm tokophobic), and according to my research, it works better when your body is more used to it. I didn't have any trouble with buying BC pills, save for this one Mercury Drug branch which asked me for a prescription. I didn't have it with me at the time, so I just showed them the empty pack. I think it's a generation thing, because I've never had a problem with it but my mother got so angry and wouldn't speak to me for weeks when she found out I was using it. She was a teenage mother who didn't get to go to college, you'd think she'd be happy that he daughter turned out a little smarter. Haha! It's also uncertain with OB-GYNs, I had one in Medical City who was full-on judgy wudgy about my pill use.

Contraception is still linked with promiscuity and the Church is very much against all forms of contraception, so that definitely hinders the average Filipino's acceptance of them. As for me, it's always BC pills + condom use, every single time. I'm working on getting an IUD before the year ends and getting sterilized by age 28. As you can imagine, I'm having a difficult time finding a doctor who can perform Essure even if I already have the money for it (I prioritized the operation money since I started working 2 years ago).

Assuming she didn't throw up, your girlfriend has completed the necessary doses.

You can throw away the remaining pills or save them for next time. 
ECP should be a last resort only, such as if a condom breaks/slips. 
You should either start using condoms regularly or she should consult an OB-gyne to have a contraceptive prescribed.

",vonbrynhilde,"i have a different case. My girlfriend used Trust Pills as ECP(8pill ecp) after taking the first 4 pills. She started bleeding after 2hours. she's due to have her period around 15-20 of july (it's the 11th when she took it.) and it's the first time she took a birth control pill. I'm really worried thats its something serious cause ive tried reading about this 8-pill ecp and they normally have their bleeding 5-7 days after taking the pills. My girlfriend had hers 2hours after taking the pill. I'm trying to rule things out.

(she's bleeding heavily like shes on her period but the color is pinkish)

a)if the pill already messed up her menstrual cycle and made it a week earlier.

b)if its breakthrough bleeding? cause its her first time.

",candymiles,"Ovulation is the time when the ovary release its egg to meet the sperm. On a typical 28-day cycle, it’s ovulation day is the 14th (half way), so if the woman’s cycle is longer or shorter than the 28cycle, just add or subtract the days. In determining the fertile window of the woman, the day of her ovulation (14th day), count 5 days before, that is the start of her fertility window. Example her ovulation is on the 24th, so 24-5 = 19. So the date 19 is the start of her fertile window. Don’t have sex on these days till ovulation day. Plus, 2-3days after ovulation. So the equation is now the 19th-26th.. don’t have sex on these days to be safe from pregnancy. Usually a woman’s typical cycle has 7-8 days fertility window.  Hope this helps.

im going to post and keep this discussion updated para sa pag take ko ng emergency contraceptive pill (ECP) para sa mga kung sakaling mapunta din sa sitwasyon ko wahahaha

so this is what happened...

i was very hesitant on what BC method i should go with, since my last method failed me(condoms) to which i did not regret because we were blessed with a beautiful baby boy 5 months ago

so eto na nga. i decided to go on with the depo shot as my BC. (and the only approved method by my OB since im breasfeeding) 

supposedly, for a 99.98% effectiveness rate, you should be scheduled for a shot within the first 5-7 days of you period in order for you to be covered and safe immediately from unprotected sex.
however, if you got your shot off your period (my dilemma right now), you will have to have an emergency or back up method(like condoms or still continue your BC pills if ur on one) for a week or two before your shot can settle in your system.
AND THIS FACT, was not disclosed by my OB, and so silly and reckless of me to not have read about the shot first before getting it.

so now my katangahan spreads.

i got my shot last June 23. my OB only said that it will stop my period and give me cramps and headaches. after 2 days (june25 in the morning) i had unprotected sex. (diba ang tanga! hahaha)

so what made me took and ECP?my mother told me to. as i have disclosed to her just that same day in the afternoon (of june 25) that i had my shot last june 23.

then she asked me if i was on my period and told her i was not. the she asked me again if i already had sex and told her i just did. hahahaha so ayun na.

she instructed me to take Trust Pills. and then it got me to search the whole internet about this contraception.


reminder, an ECP will only have high effectiveness rate, not full-proof if you took it within sa 72hours after ur unprotected sex.
AND IT WILL NOT VE EFFECTIVENIF YOU HAVE ALREADY OVULATED.(that's what i read hehehe will provide a link, this post is just a summary of what i have looked through the internet)

Aaaaand next time, be sure to be safe hehe because you cant always do this method as it will harm your precious body. you cant take an ECP every unprotected sex you have in a short period of time after your last ECP.

and that is why im writing this discussion. to help the future ladies that will be in the same boat as i am today hehe!

i took 4 trust pills today, june 27 at 1am exactly. and another 12 hours i would have to take another 4. that's what ive read.

so okay. ill update this discussion if ever i got pregnant again or what lol. wish us luck.

EDIT: i bought Trust pills at mercury drug. no prescription needed",yumemite,"okay. so i drank my second dose 3 hrs ago(1pm). 4 pills again.


and i must say the side effects are really kicking in.

the ECP is making me dizzy, i've lost my appetite, and feel like i would vomit anytime.

dbqv38u,Question about obtaining birth control,"I apologize if this is the wrong place for this, but I could really use some advice.  I live in the US, but I have family in the Philippines.  

My cousin, who is in her early 20s, recently confided in me that she has started sleeping with her boyfriend.  She's worried about getting pregnant.  They try to use condoms, but neither like the way they feel.  STDs are not an issue, as they have been together several years and were both each other's first.

I convinced her to talk to an OBGYN about birth control.  The first clinic she went to, she felt that the receptionist was giving her dirty looks before making an appointment.  I told her that this was silly, and that it was probably all in her head.  She went to her appointment, and while the doctor was very nice, he asked her if she was sure this was something that she wanted to do, and talked her out of getting pills, instead recommending that she abstain from anything further until marriage.

This shocked me, as it would never happen here.  Even if she got married tomorrow, she is not ready to start having children.  She feels as though even asking for birth control is giving the impression that she is a prostitute or, at the very least, sleeping around.

I want her to speak with a doctor, but I'd hate for her to go through such an ordeal again.  Does anyone know of any good resources for finding a more understanding doctor?  She's in Batangas and spends a lot of time in Manila, if that is any help.
",meisandsodina,"OCPs do not require prescriptions; it can be obtained over-the-counter. Nevertheless, I would suggest your cousin to seek a second opinion from another OBGyn to find the right OCP for her needs.

",typetypecat,"Wow, I had a similar experience a few years ago. I wanted my irregular periods checked and ask about birth control options as well, so a close aunt referred her doctor from St. Lukes. It was my first time going to an OB so I was pretty nervous.

So there I was in the Doc's clinic and our convo goes something like this:

OB: Hi, you must be TypeType. How can I help you today?

Me: Well I have irregular periods so that needs to get checked I think. I also wanted to ask about my BC options and see which ones would work best for me. 

OB: Are you married? Why are you asking about BC?

Me: Not married yet. I'm asking because I don't want to get pregnant.

OB: Then don't have sex. Anyway about your irregular periods--

I was a little shocked and beyond pissed at that point so after about a minute of her rambling, I firmly stood up and left. I immediately went to the lobby to ask for other available OBs, picked a random one and visited her clinic. She was kinder, but also asked if I was married. She also discouraged me from using BC pills / injectables, but to be fair she was sort of reasonable about it because it turned out I had PCOS and it would be harder for me to get pregnant if I decided to have kids. Not that I was eager to have them anytime soon but she wouldn't hear any of it.

It can be frustrating most of the time because they're not supposed to be denying patients the right to BCs based on their personal / religious beliefs. My best bet would be to go to health workers or maybe younger, more open minded doctors. ",0,t3_5kulyo,3,r/Philippines,0,1559,supporting

[UPDATED - 3 months later]

UPDATE:
It's been more than three months since I got the IUD and I still love it. The first period I had after insertion gave me terrible  cramping. Terrible cramping that I had a hard time walking around and had to sit whenever I could (take note, I never got cramps before). I took some painkillers and had to visit my OB-GYN because I got scared that maybe it was misaligned. The copper is still in place and I was just prescribed some Buscopan Venus for the pain. This lasted for about 4-5 days. Lantern parade happened and I had to push a cart around for 3 hrs and felt no pain or fatigue at all. I was  surprised to see that I started bleeding during the parade and I didn't even notice or feel anything. The period lasted longer than my usual, around 5-6 days, and it was definitely heavier, but it wasn't painful.

A few weeks later, I got scared when I was checking for my strings and couldn't touch them. I wanted to make an appointment with Likhaan to have a check-up but my tight schedule wouldn't allow me.  A few days later though, I managed to feel the strings again. All was good. Second period happened, same experience with the first.

I haven't had sex since December but I can vouch that for the last intercourse I had, the guy finished inside a lot of times and I didn't have any scares whatsoever. The IUD is effective.

Fast forward to March and my period is still irregular (12 days late) and I'm having mild cramping and cravings for certain food (nothing out of the ordinary). I'm still waiting for my 3rd period which I HOPE will come any time soon because these cravings and bloating have to stop lol. 

Will try to update you guys again in 3 or 6 months.

Hey, guys.

3 months ago, after being on the pill (Nordette and Althea) for about a year, I decided to get an implant. The insertion process wasn't painful but there was bruising a few weeks after. Then it was blissful, or so I thought.

I started getting depressed while on it. I would get sad over the smallest things and cry without even a reason. I felt so fragile. I'm that person who is either happy or mad (mostly happy, of course) and whenever I was sad, I can just think of other things and become okay again. But not with this. I would get sad all the time and my emotions were all over the place. One minute I'd be so happy and the next I'n really down and borderline suicidal. I don't have any reason to be sad or suicidal, yet I very much was. Aside from this, I was always tired and weak. I needed like 15 hrs of sleep everyday and I am in college. I have always been able to feel well rested with just 4-6 hrs of sleep but a few weeks after the implant insertion, I slept anywhere. I slept in class, during commutes, etc. I always felt sluggish and lazy. There would be times though when my energy is off the roof. I'd be working out until midnight and not be tired at all (this is my normal energy btw) but then even when I get adequate hrs of sleep (8-10), I still end up getting sluggish and sleeping in class. My hair also fell out. I would brush my hair and so much would come with it. And for about one month, I was constantly spotting. It was a hassle because it was not enough to wear a sanitary pad but it's enough to use a lot of pantyliners. 

However, it did clear up some of my acne, I got thinner, and it was painless and kind of cool to have it on my arm. I'd let people touch it and they'll either cringe or get shocked. AND IT WAS EFFECTIVE. My then partner finished inside all the time and no scares whatsoever. But the side effects were not tolerable, the mood swings were just horrible. 

So I had it removed today, and got it replaced with an IUD.

IT WAS PAINFUL. Insertion was terrible. 
I'm 21, never had a baby (and definitely no plans to) and my cervix was not used to being dilated.

The midwife/nurse who inserted it briefed me beforehand of what to expect, the number of IUDs she has inserted already, complications, etc. She made sure I was certain of my decision. She even warned me to not contract my muscles because that will cause pain (which I had a hard time not doing because having a rod inside of you was nerve-racking).

Anyway, the insertion took about 2 mins and it was hell. The nurse said I was the loudest patient she ever inserted an IUD on. I got pale afterwards and felt nauseous and poop-ish. I ended up puking and pooping at the same time (TMI). They gave me warm water and some painkillers after eating a slice of bread. I was also curled up in a ball for about 20 mins, whining about my situation. 

I went home immediately after and slept for about 4 hrs. As somebody who never had dysmenorrhea or cramps, the aftermath of cramps was bad. I woke up every now and then to massage my abdomen. My first pee after also had a lot of blood. 

It's been 5 hours since the IUD has been inserted and the pain somewhat subsided. I still feel a bit poop-ish but I can now walk around and do school work. 

IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE WHEN YOU DECIDE TO GET AN IUD:

1. Read up. Read up on everything there is about the Copper T/Paragard. The good and bad, everything.

2. Come mentally prepared. Know that this is what you want and this is for your own good. Taking control of your body. Also, don't forget to ask the nurse all your questions, no matter how ridiculous they are.

3. EAT BEFOREHAND. I cannot stress this enough. I was not able to eat since I came from school and the whole procedure became worse, according to the nurse. I ended up dizzy and hungry and nauseous all at the same time.

4. Come with a friend. I didn't. But I think it would be better if I did. You can have someone to distract you from the process and take care of you afterwards. Also, don't commute after if possible. Book an Uber or ride a car so you can go home relatively faster and without any hassle.

5. Take things lightly afterwards. Don't stress so much, don't keep worrying, and just rest. It helps to schedule your insertion when you have no pending tasks because, if you're anything like me, you would not be able to work after. 


I'll update you guys after 3 months. Hopefully, this IUD would be a better experience than the implant. 

",mitsubishi_love,">Taking control of your body.

It's a shame that in 2017, this is not something that everyone can take for granted. Too many politicians, priests and idiots, think their opinions are worth something, when it comes to this sort of shit.

One question:
1. Why not just get sterilized, and never have to worry again?

I went home immediately after and slept for about 4 hrs. As somebody who never had dysmenorrhea or cramps, the aftermath of cramps was bad. I woke up every now and then to massage my abdomen. My first pee after also had a lot of blood. 

It's been 5 hours since the IUD has been inserted and the pain somewhat subsided. I still feel a bit poop-ish but I can now walk around and do school work. 

IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE WHEN YOU DECIDE TO GET AN IUD:

1. Read up. Read up on everything there is about the Copper T/Paragard. The good and bad, everything.

2. Come mentally prepared. Know that this is what you want and this is for your own good. Taking control of your body. Also, don't forget to ask the nurse all your questions, no matter how ridiculous they are.

3. EAT BEFOREHAND. I cannot stress this enough. I was not able to eat since I came from school and the whole procedure became worse, according to the nurse. I ended up dizzy and hungry and nauseous all at the same time.

4. Come with a friend. I didn't. But I think it would be better if I did. You can have someone to distract you from the process and take care of you afterwards. Also, don't commute after if possible. Book an Uber or ride a car so you can go home relatively faster and without any hassle.

5. Take things lightly afterwards. Don't stress so much, don't keep worrying, and just rest. It helps to schedule your insertion when you have no pending tasks because, if you're anything like me, you would not be able to work after. 


I'll update you guys after 3 months. Hopefully, this IUD would be a better experience than the implant. 

",cezille07,"Thanks for sharing, and I hope it works out well for you! :D

I recently got my implant from Likhaan as well, but as I was talking to the woman who would insert it she mentioned that I could have chosen to have the IUD as well. The patient after me was getting an IUD too. However, I just wasn't prepared for it, I was only mentally prepared to get an implant. The pill I had been using hasn't been available in any drug stores for months now, an effect of the TRO. 

I have been lucky not to get side effects that bad, but I've immediately stopped getting my period, despite reading that I was supposed to still bleed for a few more months. I intend to get an IUD when I need to replace the implant. Will save this advice for then! 

Also, Likhaan is a godsend. They do good work for free. I hope more people see this and become aware that there are options, options that officials and even some OB-GYN's might look down on, but which really save lives of women. ",0,t3_7e7yuq,2,r/Philippines,0,970,supporting

[UPDATED - 3 months later]

UPDATE:
It's been more than three months since I got the IUD and I still love it. The first period I had after insertion gave me terrible  cramping. Terrible cramping that I had a hard time walking around and had to sit whenever I could (take note, I never got cramps before). I took some painkillers and had to visit my OB-GYN because I got scared that maybe it was misaligned. The copper is still in place and I was just prescribed some Buscopan Venus for the pain. This lasted for about 4-5 days. Lantern parade happened and I had to push a cart around for 3 hrs and felt no pain or fatigue at all. I was  surprised to see that I started bleeding during the parade and I didn't even notice or feel anything. The period lasted longer than my usual, around 5-6 days, and it was definitely heavier, but it wasn't painful.

A few weeks later, I got scared when I was checking for my strings and couldn't touch them. I wanted to make an appointment with Likhaan to have a check-up but my tight schedule wouldn't allow me.  A few days later though, I managed to feel the strings again. All was good. Second period happened, same experience with the first.

I haven't had sex since December but I can vouch that for the last intercourse I had, the guy finished inside a lot of times and I didn't have any scares whatsoever. The IUD is effective.

Fast forward to March and my period is still irregular (12 days late) and I'm having mild cramping and cravings for certain food (nothing out of the ordinary). I'm still waiting for my 3rd period which I HOPE will come any time soon because these cravings and bloating have to stop lol.

Hey, guys.

3 months ago, after being on the pill (Nordette and Althea) for about a year, I decided to get an implant. The insertion process wasn't painful but there was bruising a few weeks after. Then it was blissful, or so I thought.

I started getting depressed while on it. I would get sad over the smallest things and cry without even a reason. I felt so fragile. I'm that person who is either happy or mad (mostly happy, of course) and whenever I was sad, I can just think of other things and become okay again. But not with this. I would get sad all the time and my emotions were all over the place. One minute I'd be so happy and the next I'n really down and borderline suicidal. I don't have any reason to be sad or suicidal, yet I very much was. Aside from this, I was always tired and weak. I needed like 15 hrs of sleep everyday and I am in college. I have always been able to feel well rested with just 4-6 hrs of sleep but a few weeks after the implant insertion, I slept anywhere. I slept in class, during commutes, etc. I always felt sluggish and lazy. There would be times though when my energy is off the roof. I'd be working out until midnight and not be tired at all (this is my normal energy btw) but then even when I get adequate hrs of sleep (8-10), I still end up getting sluggish and sleeping in class. My hair also fell out. I would brush my hair and so much would come with it. And for about one month, I was constantly spotting. It was a hassle because it was not enough to wear a sanitary pad but it's enough to use a lot of pantyliners. 

However, it did clear up some of my acne, I got thinner, and it was painless and kind of cool to have it on my arm. I'd let people touch it and they'll either cringe or get shocked. AND IT WAS EFFECTIVE. My then partner finished inside all the time and no scares whatsoever. But the side effects were not tolerable, the mood swings were just horrible. 

So I had it removed today, and got it replaced with an IUD.

IT WAS PAINFUL. Insertion was terrible. 
I'm 21, never had a baby (and definitely no plans to) and my cervix was not used to being dilated.

The midwife/nurse who inserted it briefed me beforehand of what to expect, the number of IUDs she has inserted already, complications, etc. She made sure I was certain of my decision. She even warned me to not contract my muscles because that will cause pain (which I had a hard time not doing because having a rod inside of you was nerve-racking).

Anyway, the insertion took about 2 mins and it was hell. The nurse said I was the loudest patient she ever inserted an IUD on. I got pale afterwards and felt nauseous and poop-ish. I ended up puking and pooping at the same time (TMI). They gave me warm water and some painkillers after eating a slice of bread. I was also curled up in a ball for about 20 mins, whining about my situation. 

I went home immediately after and slept for about 4 hrs. As somebody who never had dysmenorrhea or cramps, the aftermath of cramps was bad. I woke up every now and then to massage my abdomen. My first pee after also had a lot of blood.

I don't even dare do the hormonal contraceptives. I am comfortable enough with my level of crazy, ayoko ng dagdagan pa. 

To be honest, bwisit lang talaga na they create products like that and believe na it is acceptable. Mga one month pa ata yan before you feel more normal. So I hope it goes well.

I'd be working out until midnight and not be tired at all (this is my normal energy btw) but then even when I get adequate hrs of sleep (8-10), I still end up getting sluggish and sleeping in class. My hair also fell out. I would brush my hair and so much would come with it. And for about one month, I was constantly spotting. It was a hassle because it was not enough to wear a sanitary pad but it's enough to use a lot of pantyliners. 

However, it did clear up some of my acne, I got thinner, and it was painless and kind of cool to have it on my arm. I'd let people touch it and they'll either cringe or get shocked. AND IT WAS EFFECTIVE. My then partner finished inside all the time and no scares whatsoever. But the side effects were not tolerable, the mood swings were just horrible. 

So I had it removed today, and got it replaced with an IUD.

IT WAS PAINFUL. Insertion was terrible. 
I'm 21, never had a baby (and definitely no plans to) and my cervix was not used to being dilated.

The midwife/nurse who inserted it briefed me beforehand of what to expect, the number of IUDs she has inserted already, complications, etc. She made sure I was certain of my decision. She even warned me to not contract my muscles because that will cause pain (which I had a hard time not doing because having a rod inside of you was nerve-racking).

Anyway, the insertion took about 2 mins and it was hell. The nurse said I was the loudest patient she ever inserted an IUD on. I got pale afterwards and felt nauseous and poop-ish. I ended up puking and pooping at the same time (TMI). They gave me warm water and some painkillers after eating a slice of bread. I was also curled up in a ball for about 20 mins, whining about my situation. 

I went home immediately after and slept for about 4 hrs. As somebody who never had dysmenorrhea or cramps, the aftermath of cramps was bad. I woke up every now and then to massage my abdomen. My first pee after also had a lot of blood. 

It's been 5 hours since the IUD has been inserted and the pain somewhat subsided. I still feel a bit poop-ish but I can now walk around and do school work. 

IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE WHEN YOU DECIDE TO GET AN IUD:

1. Read up. Read up on everything there is about the Copper T/Paragard. The good and bad, everything.

2. Come mentally prepared. Know that this is what you want and this is for your own good. Taking control of your body. Also, don't forget to ask the nurse all your questions, no matter how ridiculous they are.

3. EAT BEFOREHAND. I cannot stress this enough. I was not able to eat since I came from school and the whole procedure became worse, according to the nurse. I ended up dizzy and hungry and nauseous all at the same time.

4. Come with a friend. I didn't. But I think it would be better if I did. You can have someone to distract you from the process and take care of you afterwards. Also, don't commute after if possible. Book an Uber or ride a car so you can go home relatively faster and without any hassle.

5. Take things lightly afterwards. Don't stress so much, don't keep worrying, and just rest. It helps to schedule your insertion when you have no pending tasks because, if you're anything like me, you would not be able to work after. 


I'll update you guys after 3 months. Hopefully, this IUD would be a better experience than the implant.

[UPDATED - 3 months later]

UPDATE:
It's been more than three months since I got the IUD and I still love it. The first period I had after insertion gave me terrible  cramping. Terrible cramping that I had a hard time walking around and had to sit whenever I could (take note, I never got cramps before). I took some painkillers and had to visit my OB-GYN because I got scared that maybe it was misaligned. The copper is still in place and I was just prescribed some Buscopan Venus for the pain. This lasted for about 4-5 days. Lantern parade happened and I had to push a cart around for 3 hrs and felt no pain or fatigue at all. I was  surprised to see that I started bleeding during the parade and I didn't even notice or feel anything. The period lasted longer than my usual, around 5-6 days, and it was definitely heavier, but it wasn't painful.

A few weeks later, I got scared when I was checking for my strings and couldn't touch them. I wanted to make an appointment with Likhaan to have a check-up but my tight schedule wouldn't allow me.  A few days later though, I managed to feel the strings again. All was good. Second period happened, same experience with the first.

I haven't had sex since December but I can vouch that for the last intercourse I had, the guy finished inside a lot of times and I didn't have any scares whatsoever. The IUD is effective.

Fast forward to March and my period is still irregular (12 days late) and I'm having mild cramping and cravings for certain food (nothing out of the ordinary). I'm still waiting for my 3rd period which I HOPE will come any time soon because these cravings and bloating have to stop lol. 

Will try to update you guys again in 3 or 6 months.

Hey, guys.

3 months ago, after being on the pill (Nordette and Althea) for about a year, I decided to get an implant. The insertion process wasn't painful but there was bruising a few weeks after. Then it was blissful, or so I thought.

I started getting depressed while on it. I would get sad over the smallest things and cry without even a reason. I felt so fragile. I'm that person who is either happy or mad (mostly happy, of course) and whenever I was sad, I can just think of other things and become okay again. But not with this. I would get sad all the time and my emotions were all over the place. One minute I'd be so happy and the next I'n really down and borderline suicidal. I don't have any reason to be sad or suicidal, yet I very much was. Aside from this, I was always tired and weak. I needed like 15 hrs of sleep everyday and I am in college. I have always been able to feel well rested with just 4-6 hrs of sleep but a few weeks after the implant insertion, I slept anywhere. I slept in class, during commutes, etc. I always felt sluggish and lazy. There would be times though when my energy is off the roof. I'd be working out until midnight and not be tired at all (this is my normal energy btw) but then even when I get adequate hrs of sleep (8-10), I still end up getting sluggish and sleeping in class.

Hey, guys.

3 months ago, after being on the pill (Nordette and Althea) for about a year, I decided to get an implant. The insertion process wasn't painful but there was bruising a few weeks after. Then it was blissful, or so I thought.

I started getting depressed while on it. I would get sad over the smallest things and cry without even a reason. I felt so fragile. I'm that person who is either happy or mad (mostly happy, of course) and whenever I was sad, I can just think of other things and become okay again. But not with this. I would get sad all the time and my emotions were all over the place. One minute I'd be so happy and the next I'n really down and borderline suicidal. I don't have any reason to be sad or suicidal, yet I very much was. Aside from this, I was always tired and weak. I needed like 15 hrs of sleep everyday and I am in college. I have always been able to feel well rested with just 4-6 hrs of sleep but a few weeks after the implant insertion, I slept anywhere. I slept in class, during commutes, etc. I always felt sluggish and lazy. There would be times though when my energy is off the roof. I'd be working out until midnight and not be tired at all (this is my normal energy btw) but then even when I get adequate hrs of sleep (8-10), I still end up getting sluggish and sleeping in class. My hair also fell out. I would brush my hair and so much would come with it. And for about one month, I was constantly spotting. It was a hassle because it was not enough to wear a sanitary pad but it's enough to use a lot of pantyliners. 

However, it did clear up some of my acne, I got thinner, and it was painless and kind of cool to have it on my arm. I'd let people touch it and they'll either cringe or get shocked. AND IT WAS EFFECTIVE. My then partner finished inside all the time and no scares whatsoever. But the side effects were not tolerable, the mood swings were just horrible. 

So I had it removed today, and got it replaced with an IUD.

IT WAS PAINFUL. Insertion was terrible. 
I'm 21, never had a baby (and definitely no plans to) and my cervix was not used to being dilated.

The midwife/nurse who inserted it briefed me beforehand of what to expect, the number of IUDs she has inserted already, complications, etc. She made sure I was certain of my decision. She even warned me to not contract my muscles because that will cause pain (which I had a hard time not doing because having a rod inside of you was nerve-racking).

Anyway, the insertion took about 2 mins and it was hell. The nurse said I was the loudest patient she ever inserted an IUD on. I got pale afterwards and felt nauseous and poop-ish. I ended up puking and pooping at the same time (TMI). They gave me warm water and some painkillers after eating a slice of bread. I was also curled up in a ball for about 20 mins, whining about my situation. 

I went home immediately after and slept for about 4 hrs. As somebody who never had dysmenorrhea or cramps, the aftermath of cramps was bad. I woke up every now and then to massage my abdomen. My first pee after also had a lot of blood. 

It's been 5 hours since the IUD has been inserted and the pain somewhat subsided. I still feel a bit poop-ish but I can now walk around and do school work. 

IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE WHEN YOU DECIDE TO GET AN IUD:

1. Read up. Read up on everything there is about the Copper T/Paragard. The good and bad, everything.

2. Come mentally prepared. Know that this is what you want and this is for your own good. Taking control of your body. Also, don't forget to ask the nurse all your questions, no matter how ridiculous they are.

3. EAT BEFOREHAND. I cannot stress this enough. I was not able to eat since I came from school and the whole procedure became worse, according to the nurse. I ended up dizzy and hungry and nauseous all at the same time.

4. Come with a friend. I didn't. But I think it would be better if I did. You can have someone to distract you from the process and take care of you afterwards. Also, don't commute after if possible. Book an Uber or ride a car so you can go home relatively faster and without any hassle.

5. Take things lightly afterwards. Don't stress so much, don't keep worrying, and just rest. It helps to schedule your insertion when you have no pending tasks because, if you're anything like me, you would not be able to work after.

",dudetteinthekat,"Hi, I actually don't. Implants are very effective but their side effects differ per person.  Honestly, my implant experience was terrible but it was bearable, and it's not a hassle. I'd say, try it first. You can always have it removed if it doesn't suit you.

Additionally, the implant's insertion is painless whereas the IUD is not.

I haven't had sex since December but I can vouch that for the last intercourse I had, the guy finished inside a lot of times and I didn't have any scares whatsoever. The IUD is effective.

Fast forward to March and my period is still irregular (12 days late) and I'm having mild cramping and cravings for certain food (nothing out of the ordinary). I'm still waiting for my 3rd period which I HOPE will come any time soon because these cravings and bloating have to stop lol. 

Will try to update you guys again in 3 or 6 months.

Hey, guys.

3 months ago, after being on the pill (Nordette and Althea) for about a year, I decided to get an implant. The insertion process wasn't painful but there was bruising a few weeks after. Then it was blissful, or so I thought.

I started getting depressed while on it. I would get sad over the smallest things and cry without even a reason. I felt so fragile. I'm that person who is either happy or mad (mostly happy, of course) and whenever I was sad, I can just think of other things and become okay again. But not with this. I would get sad all the time and my emotions were all over the place. One minute I'd be so happy and the next I'n really down and borderline suicidal. I don't have any reason to be sad or suicidal, yet I very much was. Aside from this, I was always tired and weak. I needed like 15 hrs of sleep everyday and I am in college. I have always been able to feel well rested with just 4-6 hrs of sleep but a few weeks after the implant insertion, I slept anywhere. I slept in class, during commutes, etc. I always felt sluggish and lazy. There would be times though when my energy is off the roof. I'd be working out until midnight and not be tired at all (this is my normal energy btw) but then even when I get adequate hrs of sleep (8-10), I still end up getting sluggish and sleeping in class. My hair also fell out. I would brush my hair and so much would come with it. And for about one month, I was constantly spotting. It was a hassle because it was not enough to wear a sanitary pad but it's enough to use a lot of pantyliners. 

However, it did clear up some of my acne, I got thinner, and it was painless and kind of cool to have it on my arm. I'd let people touch it and they'll either cringe or get shocked. AND IT WAS EFFECTIVE. My then partner finished inside all the time and no scares whatsoever. But the side effects were not tolerable, the mood swings were just horrible. 

So I had it removed today, and got it replaced with an IUD.

IT WAS PAINFUL. Insertion was terrible. 
I'm 21, never had a baby (and definitely no plans to) and my cervix was not used to being dilated.

The midwife/nurse who inserted it briefed me beforehand of what to expect, the number of IUDs she has inserted already, complications, etc. She made sure I was certain of my decision. She even warned me to not contract my muscles because that will cause pain (which I had a hard time not doing because having a rod inside of you was nerve-racking).

Anyway, the insertion took about 2 mins and it was hell. The nurse said I was the loudest patient she ever inserted an IUD on. I got pale afterwards and felt nauseous and poop-ish. I ended up puking and pooping at the same time (TMI). They gave me warm water and some painkillers after eating a slice of bread. I was also curled up in a ball for about 20 mins, whining about my situation. 

I went home immediately after and slept for about 4 hrs. As somebody who never had dysmenorrhea or cramps, the aftermath of cramps was bad. I woke up every now and then to massage my abdomen. My first pee after also had a lot of blood. 

It's been 5 hours since the IUD has been inserted and the pain somewhat subsided. I still feel a bit poop-ish but I can now walk around and do school work. 

IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE WHEN YOU DECIDE TO GET AN IUD:

1. Read up. Read up on everything there is about the Copper T/Paragard. The good and bad, everything.

2. Come mentally prepared. Know that this is what you want and this is for your own good. Taking control of your body. Also, don't forget to ask the nurse all your questions, no matter how ridiculous they are.

3. EAT BEFOREHAND. I cannot stress this enough. I was not able to eat since I came from school and the whole procedure became worse, according to the nurse. I ended up dizzy and hungry and nauseous all at the same time.

4. Come with a friend. I didn't. But I think it would be better if I did. You can have someone to distract you from the process and take care of you afterwards. Also, don't commute after if possible. Book an Uber or ride a car so you can go home relatively faster and without any hassle.

5. Take things lightly afterwards. Don't stress so much, don't keep worrying, and just rest. It helps to schedule your insertion when you have no pending tasks because, if you're anything like me, you would not be able to work after. 


I'll update you guys after 3 months. Hopefully, this IUD would be a better experience than the implant. 

",dudetteinthekat,"For the implant, normalization is around 3-6 months but again, it varies depending on the person. 

As for the copper IUD, the side effect really is heavier periods. If you can handle that, I think you ought to give it a try. And normalization is also 3-6 months.

Idk about you but my mindset is, I'll try my options while I can (and because I am really horny). Tbh, I was afraid of getting into birth control generally because of the side effects but personally, it is way better than getting pregnant. ",1,t1_dq392bo,4,r/Philippines,4,509,supporting

[UPDATED - 3 months later]

UPDATE:
It's been more than three months since I got the IUD and I still love it. The first period I had after insertion gave me terrible  cramping. Terrible cramping that I had a hard time walking around and had to sit whenever I could (take note, I never got cramps before). I took some painkillers and had to visit my OB-GYN because I got scared that maybe it was misaligned. The copper is still in place and I was just prescribed some Buscopan Venus for the pain. This lasted for about 4-5 days. Lantern parade happened and I had to push a cart around for 3 hrs and felt no pain or fatigue at all. I was  surprised to see that I started bleeding during the parade and I didn't even notice or feel anything. The period lasted longer than my usual, around 5-6 days, and it was definitely heavier, but it wasn't painful.

A few weeks later, I got scared when I was checking for my strings and couldn't touch them. I wanted to make an appointment with Likhaan to have a check-up but my tight schedule wouldn't allow me.  A few days later though, I managed to feel the strings again. All was good. Second period happened, same experience with the first.

",mitsubishi_love,"> Well, hospitals here don't sterilize women my age because they believe that we will regret it. No matter how much I pushed, they declined. I asked 3 diff hospitals and several doctors, was willing to pay the fee, but they all declined. 

Oh well, so much for having control over your own body.
I thought the procedure was reversible or is that only the male sterilization that's reversible?

Hey, guys.

3 months ago, after being on the pill (Nordette and Althea) for about a year, I decided to get an implant. The insertion process wasn't painful but there was bruising a few weeks after. Then it was blissful, or so I thought.

I started getting depressed while on it. I would get sad over the smallest things and cry without even a reason. I felt so fragile. I'm that person who is either happy or mad (mostly happy, of course) and whenever I was sad, I can just think of other things and become okay again. But not with this. I would get sad all the time and my emotions were all over the place. One minute I'd be so happy and the next I'n really down and borderline suicidal. I don't have any reason to be sad or suicidal, yet I very much was. Aside from this, I was always tired and weak. I needed like 15 hrs of sleep everyday and I am in college. I have always been able to feel well rested with just 4-6 hrs of sleep but a few weeks after the implant insertion, I slept anywhere. I slept in class, during commutes, etc. I always felt sluggish and lazy. There would be times though when my energy is off the roof. I'd be working out until midnight and not be tired at all (this is my normal energy btw) but then even when I get adequate hrs of sleep (8-10), I still end up getting sluggish and sleeping in class. My hair also fell out. I would brush my hair and so much would come with it. And for about one month, I was constantly spotting. It was a hassle because it was not enough to wear a sanitary pad but it's enough to use a lot of pantyliners. 

However, it did clear up some of my acne, I got thinner, and it was painless and kind of cool to have it on my arm. I'd let people touch it and they'll either cringe or get shocked. AND IT WAS EFFECTIVE. My then partner finished inside all the time and no scares whatsoever. But the side effects were not tolerable, the mood swings were just horrible. 

So I had it removed today, and got it replaced with an IUD.

IT WAS PAINFUL. Insertion was terrible. 
I'm 21, never had a baby (and definitely no plans to) and my cervix was not used to being dilated.

The midwife/nurse who inserted it briefed me beforehand of what to expect, the number of IUDs she has inserted already, complications, etc. She made sure I was certain of my decision. She even warned me to not contract my muscles because that will cause pain (which I had a hard time not doing because having a rod inside of you was nerve-racking).

Anyway, the insertion took about 2 mins and it was hell. The nurse said I was the loudest patient she ever inserted an IUD on. I got pale afterwards and felt nauseous and poop-ish. I ended up puking and pooping at the same time (TMI). They gave me warm water and some painkillers after eating a slice of bread. I was also curled up in a ball for about 20 mins, whining about my situation. 

I went home immediately after and slept for about 4 hrs. As somebody who never had dysmenorrhea or cramps, the aftermath of cramps was bad. I woke up every now and then to massage my abdomen. My first pee after also had a lot of blood. 

It's been 5 hours since the IUD has been inserted and the pain somewhat subsided. I still feel a bit poop-ish but I can now walk around and do school work. 

IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE WHEN YOU DECIDE TO GET AN IUD:

1. Read up. Read up on everything there is about the Copper T/Paragard. The good and bad, everything.

2. Come mentally prepared. Know that this is what you want and this is for your own good. Taking control of your body. Also, don't forget to ask the nurse all your questions, no matter how ridiculous they are.

3. EAT BEFOREHAND. I cannot stress this enough. I was not able to eat since I came from school and the whole procedure became worse, according to the nurse. I ended up dizzy and hungry and nauseous all at the same time.

4. Come with a friend. I didn't. But I think it would be better if I did. You can have someone to distract you from the process and take care of you afterwards. Also, don't commute after if possible. Book an Uber or ride a car so you can go home relatively faster and without any hassle.

5. Take things lightly afterwards. Don't stress so much, don't keep worrying, and just rest. It helps to schedule your insertion when you have no pending tasks because, if you're anything like me, you would not be able to work after. 


I'll update you guys after 3 months. Hopefully, this IUD would be a better experience than the implant. 

",dudetteinthekat,"Yeah, you can have it removed. They give you a card upon insertion which you bring when you wish to have it removed/replaced. Idk about other Likhaan branches but mine, even though they were hesitant because it takes 3-6 months to get used to an implant, respected my decision. They removed the implant right away after counseling.

I had mine for 3 months. ",3,t1_dq38yb5,1,r/Philippines,4,360,supporting

[UPDATED - 3 months later]

UPDATE:
It's been more than three months since I got the IUD and I still love it. The first period I had after insertion gave me terrible  cramping. Terrible cramping that I had a hard time walking around and had to sit whenever I could (take note, I never got cramps before). I took some painkillers and had to visit my OB-GYN because I got scared that maybe it was misaligned. The copper is still in place and I was just prescribed some Buscopan Venus for the pain. This lasted for about 4-5 days. Lantern parade happened and I had to push a cart around for 3 hrs and felt no pain or fatigue at all. I was  surprised to see that I started bleeding during the parade and I didn't even notice or feel anything. The period lasted longer than my usual, around 5-6 days, and it was definitely heavier, but it wasn't painful.

A few weeks later, I got scared when I was checking for my strings and couldn't touch them. I wanted to make an appointment with Likhaan to have a check-up but my tight schedule wouldn't allow me.  A few days later though, I managed to feel the strings again. All was good. Second period happened, same experience with the first.

I haven't had sex since December but I can vouch that for the last intercourse I had, the guy finished inside a lot of times and I didn't have any scares whatsoever. The IUD is effective.

Fast forward to March and my period is still irregular (12 days late) and I'm having mild cramping and cravings for certain food (nothing out of the ordinary). I'm still waiting for my 3rd period which I HOPE will come any time soon because these cravings and bloating have to stop lol. 

Will try to update you guys again in 3 or 6 months.

Hey, guys.

3 months ago, after being on the pill (Nordette and Althea) for about a year, I decided to get an implant. The insertion process wasn't painful but there was bruising a few weeks after. Then it was blissful, or so I thought.

I started getting depressed while on it. I would get sad over the smallest things and cry without even a reason. I felt so fragile. I'm that person who is either happy or mad (mostly happy, of course) and whenever I was sad, I can just think of other things and become okay again. But not with this. I would get sad all the time and my emotions were all over the place. One minute I'd be so happy and the next I'n really down and borderline suicidal. I don't have any reason to be sad or suicidal, yet I very much was. Aside from this, I was always tired and weak. I needed like 15 hrs of sleep everyday and I am in college. I have always been able to feel well rested with just 4-6 hrs of sleep but a few weeks after the implant insertion, I slept anywhere. I slept in class, during commutes, etc. I always felt sluggish and lazy. There would be times though when my energy is off the roof. I'd be working out until midnight and not be tired at all (this is my normal energy btw) but then even when I get adequate hrs of sleep (8-10), I still end up getting sluggish and sleeping in class. My hair also fell out. I would brush my hair and so much would come with it. And for about one month, I was constantly spotting. It was a hassle because it was not enough to wear a sanitary pad but it's enough to use a lot of pantyliners. 

However, it did clear up some of my acne, I got thinner, and it was painless and kind of cool to have it on my arm. I'd let people touch it and they'll either cringe or get shocked. AND IT WAS EFFECTIVE. My then partner finished inside all the time and no scares whatsoever. But the side effects were not tolerable, the mood swings were just horrible. 

So I had it removed today, and got it replaced with an IUD.

IT WAS PAINFUL. Insertion was terrible. 
I'm 21, never had a baby (and definitely no plans to) and my cervix was not used to being dilated.

The midwife/nurse who inserted it briefed me beforehand of what to expect, the number of IUDs she has inserted already, complications, etc. She made sure I was certain of my decision. She even warned me to not contract my muscles because that will cause pain (which I had a hard time not doing because having a rod inside of you was nerve-racking).

Anyway, the insertion took about 2 mins and it was hell. The nurse said I was the loudest patient she ever inserted an IUD on. I got pale afterwards and felt nauseous and poop-ish. I ended up puking and pooping at the same time (TMI). They gave me warm water and some painkillers after eating a slice of bread. I was also curled up in a ball for about 20 mins, whining about my situation. 

I went home immediately after and slept for about 4 hrs. As somebody who never had dysmenorrhea or cramps, the aftermath of cramps was bad. I woke up every now and then to massage my abdomen. My first pee after also had a lot of blood. 

It's been 5 hours since the IUD has been inserted and the pain somewhat subsided. I still feel a bit poop-ish but I can now walk around and do school work. 

IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE WHEN YOU DECIDE TO GET AN IUD:

1. Read up. Read up on everything there is about the Copper T/Paragard. The good and bad, everything.

2. Come mentally prepared. Know that this is what you want and this is for your own good. Taking control of your body. Also, don't forget to ask the nurse all your questions, no matter how ridiculous they are.

3. EAT BEFOREHAND. I cannot stress this enough. I was not able to eat since I came from school and the whole procedure became worse, according to the nurse. I ended up dizzy and hungry and nauseous all at the same time.

4. Come with a friend. I didn't. But I think it would be better if I did. You can have someone to distract you from the process and take care of you afterwards. Also, don't commute after if possible. Book an Uber or ride a car so you can go home relatively faster and without any hassle.

",kindoftemporary,"Regarding your extreme mood swings, did you experience them too while on birth control? 

I've been struggling with acne for a more than a year now so I tried BC and dropped it after three months because I'm getting more breakouts. Your comment about your acne clearing up is totally encouraging me about this hahaha. But I know there are still other factors to take into consideration. 

Did you consult an ob-gyne before getting the implant? I'm thinking of skipping it hahahaha. I didn't have a good experience with my first ob-gyne visit with the assistant in there making me feel bad about asking for BC just because I'm unmarried and haven't had a kid yet -_- way to go ate haha.

So I had it removed today, and got it replaced with an IUD.

IT WAS PAINFUL. Insertion was terrible. 
I'm 21, never had a baby (and definitely no plans to) and my cervix was not used to being dilated.

The midwife/nurse who inserted it briefed me beforehand of what to expect, the number of IUDs she has inserted already, complications, etc. She made sure I was certain of my decision. She even warned me to not contract my muscles because that will cause pain (which I had a hard time not doing because having a rod inside of you was nerve-racking).

Anyway, the insertion took about 2 mins and it was hell. The nurse said I was the loudest patient she ever inserted an IUD on. I got pale afterwards and felt nauseous and poop-ish. I ended up puking and pooping at the same time (TMI). They gave me warm water and some painkillers after eating a slice of bread. I was also curled up in a ball for about 20 mins, whining about my situation. 

I went home immediately after and slept for about 4 hrs. As somebody who never had dysmenorrhea or cramps, the aftermath of cramps was bad. I woke up every now and then to massage my abdomen. My first pee after also had a lot of blood. 

It's been 5 hours since the IUD has been inserted and the pain somewhat subsided. I still feel a bit poop-ish but I can now walk around and do school work. 

IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE WHEN YOU DECIDE TO GET AN IUD:

1. Read up. Read up on everything there is about the Copper T/Paragard. The good and bad, everything.

2. Come mentally prepared. Know that this is what you want and this is for your own good. Taking control of your body. Also, don't forget to ask the nurse all your questions, no matter how ridiculous they are.

3. EAT BEFOREHAND. I cannot stress this enough. I was not able to eat since I came from school and the whole procedure became worse, according to the nurse. I ended up dizzy and hungry and nauseous all at the same time.

4. Come with a friend. I didn't. But I think it would be better if I did. You can have someone to distract you from the process and take care of you afterwards. Also, don't commute after if possible. Book an Uber or ride a car so you can go home relatively faster and without any hassle.

5. Take things lightly afterwards. Don't stress so much, don't keep worrying, and just rest. It helps to schedule your insertion when you have no pending tasks because, if you're anything like me, you would not be able to work after. 


I'll update you guys after 3 months. Hopefully, this IUD would be a better experience than the implant. 

",childfreefilipina,"I think people respond differently. It could be that it's messing up your cycle... But if you feel anything like bloating or abdominal pain, you should definitely check back in with your doctor. I had mine inserted shortly after my period so I don't know what would have happened if I got it before the period.",4,t1_dr18cur,1,r/Philippines,4,310,supporting

[UPDATED - 3 months later]

UPDATE:
It's been more than three months since I got the IUD and I still love it. The first period I had after insertion gave me terrible  cramping. Terrible cramping that I had a hard time walking around and had to sit whenever I could (take note, I never got cramps before). I took some painkillers and had to visit my OB-GYN because I got scared that maybe it was misaligned. The copper is still in place and I was just prescribed some Buscopan Venus for the pain. This lasted for about 4-5 days. Lantern parade happened and I had to push a cart around for 3 hrs and felt no pain or fatigue at all. I was  surprised to see that I started bleeding during the parade and I didn't even notice or feel anything. The period lasted longer than my usual, around 5-6 days, and it was definitely heavier, but it wasn't painful.

A few weeks later, I got scared when I was checking for my strings and couldn't touch them. I wanted to make an appointment with Likhaan to have a check-up but my tight schedule wouldn't allow me.  A few days later though, I managed to feel the strings again. All was good. Second period happened, same experience with the first.

I haven't had sex since December but I can vouch that for the last intercourse I had, the guy finished inside a lot of times and I didn't have any scares whatsoever. The IUD is effective.

Fast forward to March and my period is still irregular (12 days late) and I'm having mild cramping and cravings for certain food (nothing out of the ordinary). I'm still waiting for my 3rd period which I HOPE will come any time soon because these cravings and bloating have to stop lol.

Hey, guys.

3 months ago, after being on the pill (Nordette and Althea) for about a year, I decided to get an implant. The insertion process wasn't painful but there was bruising a few weeks after. Then it was blissful, or so I thought.

I started getting depressed while on it. I would get sad over the smallest things and cry without even a reason. I felt so fragile. I'm that person who is either happy or mad (mostly happy, of course) and whenever I was sad, I can just think of other things and become okay again. But not with this. I would get sad all the time and my emotions were all over the place. One minute I'd be so happy and the next I'n really down and borderline suicidal. I don't have any reason to be sad or suicidal, yet I very much was. Aside from this, I was always tired and weak. I needed like 15 hrs of sleep everyday and I am in college. I have always been able to feel well rested with just 4-6 hrs of sleep but a few weeks after the implant insertion, I slept anywhere. I slept in class, during commutes, etc. I always felt sluggish and lazy. There would be times though when my energy is off the roof. I'd be working out until midnight and not be tired at all (this is my normal energy btw) but then even when I get adequate hrs of sleep (8-10), I still end up getting sluggish and sleeping in class. My hair also fell out. I would brush my hair and so much would come with it. And for about one month, I was constantly spotting. It was a hassle because it was not enough to wear a sanitary pad but it's enough to use a lot of pantyliners. 

However, it did clear up some of my acne, I got thinner, and it was painless and kind of cool to have it on my arm. I'd let people touch it and they'll either cringe or get shocked. AND IT WAS EFFECTIVE. My then partner finished inside all the time and no scares whatsoever. But the side effects were not tolerable, the mood swings were just horrible.

",dudetteinthekat,"No, actually. That's why I was 100% willing to get an implant because I never experienced mood swings on the pill. But that experience only proves that hormonal BC really has different effects.

Well, you should also know that I don't have bad acne. I have maybe 4-5 small ones on my forehead that never go away and tiny clogged pores but that's about it. My face is also very sensitive to various products. The implant managed to keep acne at bay/cleared some of them.

I did. Yeah, I've been to a lot of OB-GYNs and some are really old-fashioned with their thinking. That being said, who gives a shit? Haha it's not their body. We go to them for advice and checkups, that's about it. I say, ignore their judgmental looks and just keep asking your questions. Or if possible, look for another OB-GYN, particularly the younger ones (they're more open to this based on my experience).

Research on it can probably take years. (Correct me if I'm wrong, please) I'm not sure if we will still have contraceptives in PH by then.

Is there any other way to amend this so that the TRO will be lifted faster? Changing the legal definition of abortificient, perhaps?

I just want this TRO to be lifted already orz;

TL;DR : Legal definition of 'abortificient' makes me hella pissed, I want to work around that",Teantis,"It's not my philosophical stance, I don't agree with it and I'm also for a woman's right to an abortion.  I'm just explaining their reasoning following from their fundamental foundational belief of life  begins at conception. 

What  you asked  for in your first  paragraph I presume is because their goal (the petitioners) is not to reach a compromise where this specific **type** of contraception is barred (the post fertilization pre implantation type) but to have all contraception barred but the legal constraints  of the RH bill make it difficult to do that in an upfront manner.  For the majority opinion on the Supreme Court, I don't know. Maybe they don't know the finer  technical details of the different types of contraception and their potential or lack of potential to be used as an abortifacient. Maybe the opposing side didn't make their case well. It's difficult to say unless you comb through the case transcripts (which I'm not going to do) and even then there'd be a lot of speculation involved.  My analysis of the petitioner's motivations are also speculation I would add, but one that has a bit more grounding in available evidence. 

Edit: also thanks for asking politely when you thought I had an opposing viewpoint. 

Edit 2: also the fact that it's a TRO on licensing for sale and distribution rather than the pills themselves seems like they just punted it down the road.  There's a couple of possible motivations for that:

Cynical : they thought no one would notice immediately because there's no immediate drying up of supplies but the effective ban on contraceptives becomes the default position (which has proven true up to now) 

Optimistic: they thought it would be revisited with more science or available evidence to make a decision before the issue started becoming a major problem. 

Hopeless? Resigned?: they just didn't want to make a decision either way because it'd be controversial whichever way they decided. ",2,t1_dh0oie1,2,r/Philippines,4,1966,supporting
dh0pmcu,A question regarding the TRO on hormonal contraceptives.,"In section 4 in the [RH law](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/research/Philippines/Republic%20Act%2010354.pdf), the definition of 'abortificient'
> refers to any drug or device that induces abortion or the destruction of a fetus inside the mother’s womb or the ***prevention of the fertilized ovum to reach and be implanted in the mother’s womb upon determination of the FDA*** 

And the reason why there's a TRO on hormonal contraceptives is because one of the back up functions is thinning the endometrium lining, thus making it difficult for a fertilized ovum to be implanted in the uterus. (Although, its primary function to prevent pregnancy is to not let ovulation happen.) [[source](https://courses.washington.edu/conj/bess/contraception/contraception.htm)]

I don't have the time to go through that much case transcripts either. There's an ongoing petition that opposes this TRO, but I have no clue how they would present their side to the SC. I do hope that they would also use the law, like how ALFI did it. As for speculations about the petitioner's motivations... I want to ask them directly. Not sure if that is possible though.

ei72l4b,I used trust pills as contraceptives,"Me and my bf had sex last thursday march 7, i had to eat dinner and drank 4 trust pills then after 12 hrs i drank 4 trust pills again. However after a while of trying to eat i puked. So i panicked and asked my bf if i should drink again, he said according to the internet once you puke you must’ve puked some of the pills. So he advised me to drink another 4 trust pills. I drank it by 4pm on friday, this time i just ate an apple instead of a rice meal. I would still feel nauseous and have stomach cramps. Right now im trying to fix my uti (in which i never have had any), im planning to go to the hospital in secret, so i threw away my trust pills already. I have further questions:

We are not ready to have a child yet that's why im asking ( we are both 17years old).
So we had sex on january 8 (wednesday).  I used condom and i also finished outside. Nag karegla sya nung December 26-january 4-bleeding period (9days) (btw irregular sya). So after the day we had sex she took 4 trust pills an another four after 12hrs sa sobrang paranoid ko (less than 24 hours from our sex tinake nya agad) . So her period lasted on December 26-jan4 then we had sex on January 8 (Tuesday). Her period lasted longer than expected and she is a irregular 

1.Is it possible for a pre-cum to leak on the base of a condom while penetrating. 

2.can a sperm from pre-cum can reach an egg if it was in labia majora or minora

3.was it safe to have sex on the details i gave?, is she fertile?

4.will the pills work on her if ever a sperm entered and what should we expect after consumption 

5.Magkamukha ba ang semen at arousal fluid baka ayun kasi nakita ko e? 

Need your help!. I am completely stressed about this

UPDATE:  She got her period just now!!!. We are both so happy!. 
What Happen: she experienced withdrawal bleeding exactly 7days after complete the dosage of Trust pills as an ECP.  It was like a normal period but a bit more painful than the usual, it lasted for 7 days. She got her Actual Period today which is exactly 30 days from the day the withdrawal bleeding ended (January 14 or 15, not sure tho), results may differ to other female. The actual period can be 1 week earlier or 1 week late from the end of the withdrawal bleeding.
Our results are normal because she is not paranoid and being stressed to the situation. Stress is a huge factor, it can affect the expected date of your period.

She is not pregnant. She consumed ecp after we had sex and i was using a condom and it didn't break.  We were just paranoid if a pre-cum leaked during intercourse that's why she took it. 
It's either we were already safe just from using the condom or a pre cum leaked on the base of the condom and the trust pills prevented her to be pregnant. ALWAYS USE A CONDOM. PRACTICE SAFE SEX!.  DON'T BE PARANOID

",Tiniwiens,"First of all, chill. I'm proud that you actually used a condom. Keep that up.

If you used a condom properly, meaning you put it on before penetration (merong gumagamit nito, uunahin penetration, tapos pag malapit na sila saka nila sinusuot ang condom, which is dumb af) and the condom is not expired/tampered with, getting pregnant is very slim (partner that with ejaculating outside the vagina, your chances are slimmer). 

You mentioned that your gf is irregular, that means she has to monitor her periods for about 3 to 4 months to be able to pinpoint (calculate) exactly when she is ovulating. So please do not attempt to do the calendar method or other natural methods as this would be tricky for women who are irregular.

Precum contains sperm, but not as much, and I mentioned on another comment that a decent amount of this sperm is most likely dead (your urethra is acidic because of pee, the purpose of precum is, aside from lubrication, it also turns the urethra basic so that sperm from your semen would survive) pero there is also a chance (albeit very slim) that sperm from precum survives (remember, it only takes 1 sperm to fertilize an egg).

Some women's arousal fluid do look like semen although it would smell a bit different than semen. But usually it resembles egg whites. 

Pero basing from your story, I highly doubt she could get pregnant as you seem to have taken the right preventive measures (again, only if you did them correctly).

I was a nurse. Gave sex ed here and there.

It was like a normal period but a bit more painful than the usual, it lasted for 7 days. She got her Actual Period today which is exactly 30 days from the day the withdrawal bleeding ended (January 14 or 15, not sure tho), results may differ to other female. The actual period can be 1 week earlier or 1 week late from the end of the withdrawal bleeding.
Our results are normal because she is not paranoid and being stressed to the situation. Stress is a huge factor, it can affect the expected date of your period.

She is not pregnant. She consumed ecp after we had sex and i was using a condom and it didn't break.  We were just paranoid if a pre-cum leaked during intercourse that's why she took it. 
It's either we were already safe just from using the condom or a pre cum leaked on the base of the condom and the trust pills prevented her to be pregnant. ALWAYS USE A CONDOM. PRACTICE SAFE SEX!.  DON'T BE PARANOID

",sk8er_saix,">  So after the day we had sex she took 4 trust pills an another four after 12hrs sa sobrang paranoid ko 

Please don't do this. :) Depending on the pill she took she might not get her period at all. Some pills do that. That's why my wife stopped taking those. I just use condom. As per experience, pills mess up a woman's chemistry. If you were using condoms and you put it on correctly, then you should be fine. Baon kang lube next time. Kung tama pagkakaalala ko, water based dapat. Para iwas masira yung condom.

Also, just some tips: 

1) Wag kayo ma stress or maparanoid kapag tingin niyo delayed mens niya, lalong madedelay yun pag stressed siya.

2) Always pee after cumming, washes out leftover sperm. This is especially important in raw penetration.

",IM_USirNim,"Yo bro. I have a tip for your gf and you.
As a fellow woman who also went through the same situation with her bf (sa first time namin). I just wish someone gave me this advice before we panicked back then haha:

Since she's just taking pills...her period will be super delayed (expected sa first month of pill intake) so don't panic. 

The pills can help her with her irregularities by basically controlling the hormone flow. But she will have to take it daily. I also suggest using a menstrual tracker app (I use Flow) because they're useful in keeping track of fertile days and whatnot.

Pero since you'll be using pills....her fertility won't be a problem. 

Also, when using pills you can have sex as much as you'd like....just be wary of times before and after the period...(use condoms and be safe that time). 

She will still have aches and pains from PMS, tho lesser...(depends on each person, but usu the pain is subdued). 

Have fun guys. Be safe.
Sex ain't wrong if you're learning to love yourself and your partner. Especially if it's a meaningful experience. ",0,t3_afhuxj,3,r/Philippines,4,1086,supporting

",LandoTagaButas,"These answers are based from experience so take it with a grain of salt.


1. Unless the condom is loose and your penis is very short, then no.

2. No. It would probably die before it reaches the cervix, which is the entrance to the uterus.

3. Condom only has around 99% success rate because it can break or slip. YES, she was fertile. BUT that's only if she has a regular cycle. But since she doesn't, we can't be sure.

UPDATE:  She got her period just now!!!. We are both so happy!. 
What Happen: she experienced withdrawal bleeding exactly 7days after complete the dosage of Trust pills as an ECP.  It was like a normal period but a bit more painful than the usual, it lasted for 7 days. She got her Actual Period today which is exactly 30 days from the day the withdrawal bleeding ended (January 14 or 15, not sure tho), results may differ to other female. The actual period can be 1 week earlier or 1 week late from the end of the withdrawal bleeding.
Our results are normal because she is not paranoid and being stressed to the situation. Stress is a huge factor, it can affect the expected date of your period.

She is not pregnant. She consumed ecp after we had sex and i was using a condom and it didn't break.  We were just paranoid if a pre-cum leaked during intercourse that's why she took it. 
It's either we were already safe just from using the condom or a pre cum leaked on the base of the condom and the trust pills prevented her to be pregnant. ALWAYS USE A CONDOM. PRACTICE SAFE SEX!.  DON'T BE PARANOID

",,"AFAIK the most effective birth control (next to abstaining lol) is the copper wire IUD.  Though if your penis is long enough you can technically feel the wires (because most women's cervix is only 5.5 to 7 inches deep and the bottom of the IUD is there).

Funny thing is I am from a western country and most women I knew were ignorant about IUDs.  Most prefer pills because of the popular belief that they suppress or eliminate acne. ",0,t3_afhuxj,2,r/Philippines,8,436,supporting

So we had sex on january 8 (wednesday).  I used condom and i also finished outside. Nag karegla sya nung December 26-january 4-bleeding period (9days) (btw irregular sya). So after the day we had sex she took 4 trust pills an another four after 12hrs sa sobrang paranoid ko (less than 24 hours from our sex tinake nya agad) . So her period lasted on December 26-jan4 then we had sex on January 8 (Tuesday). Her period lasted longer than expected and she is a irregular 

1.Is it possible for a pre-cum to leak on the base of a condom while penetrating. 

2.can a sperm from pre-cum can reach an egg if it was in labia majora or minora

3.was it safe to have sex on the details i gave?, is she fertile?

4.will the pills work on her if ever a sperm entered and what should we expect after consumption 

5.Magkamukha ba ang semen at arousal fluid baka ayun kasi nakita ko e? 

Need your help!. I am completely stressed about this

UPDATE:  She got her period just now!!!. We are both so happy!. 
What Happen: she experienced withdrawal bleeding exactly 7days after complete the dosage of Trust pills as an ECP.  It was like a normal period but a bit more painful than the usual, it lasted for 7 days. She got her Actual Period today which is exactly 30 days from the day the withdrawal bleeding ended (January 14 or 15, not sure tho), results may differ to other female. The actual period can be 1 week earlier or 1 week late from the end of the withdrawal bleeding.
Our results are normal because she is not paranoid and being stressed to the situation. Stress is a huge factor, it can affect the expected date of your period.

She is not pregnant. She consumed ecp after we had sex and i was using a condom and it didn't break.  We were just paranoid if a pre-cum leaked during intercourse that's why she took it. 
It's either we were already safe just from using the condom or a pre cum leaked on the base of the condom and the trust pills prevented her to be pregnant. ALWAYS USE A CONDOM. PRACTICE SAFE SEX!.  DON'T BE PARANOID

",Tiniwiens,"""It is possible for small amounts of sperm to exit your reproductive system and make its way into the precum or pre-ejaculate.
Can you get pregnant with precum?  The common answer is no; however, women around the world have become pregnant from precum, and thus we cannot rule out the possibility.
There are rare cases where living sperm can be present in the precum and conception subsequently possible. Precum is one reason that we suggest that all couples who are not trying to get pregnant use a condom the whole time there is penetration (when the penis enters the vagina).""

dvkeoae,Just got an IUD from Likhaan! Thought I’d share my experience,"First of all, thanks for all the posts about Likhaan in this subreddit. It’s where I found out about them, and I’m so glad I did. The people there were super duper nice and friendly.

I got a copper IUD (copper T) just today from the central office of Likhaan Center for Women’s Health, the one in Project 8, Quezon City. Like I mentioned the people were super friendly and accomodating. I was asked to take a quick health questionnaire, that asked some info about my health history, last period, birth control methods I use, and some questions to determine if I was pregnant or not, and I was also given an explanation about the copper T, the side effects with the cramps, how it actually works as a birth control method, etc.

As for the pain, before they inserted the IUD I think they used some stuff to open it up down there and also measure the inside. This was what hurt the most for me. The woman there told me the cramps can be worse for women like me who haven’t had children yet. While they were doing that I had really intense cramps that went on for around 10 minutes. It depends on people’s pain tolerance but personally it hurt quite a lot for me. 

The actual IUD insertion took I think maybe 30 seconds, it hurt a bit but it was over so fast and I didn’t feel it as badly as I expected. The entire time, they were very reassuring, telling me every so often to relax and just take deep breaths. 

The woman also asked where I found out about them and I said it was from Reddit. She said apparently they used to check the Reddit posts about them but haven’t been able to do so lately. I reassured her that it’s all good reviews so she doesn’t have to worry.

Also in addition, she told me to advise people to call their clinic first before coming in. She said they had a time period before that people came almost everyday, but the people who do the IUD insertion aren’t in the clinic all the time, they’re only there every other Monday. So she told me to advise people to always call ahead first before going to be sure there’s someone there who can do the procedure. 

Overall, I *really* didn’t like the pain, it was quite bad for me but it didn’t really last that long, so overall I’d say it was okay. The people at their office were really really nice and I can’t recommend them enough if you’re looking to get a *free* IUD insertion. 

Thanks again r/philippines for all the informative posts about them and the amazing people at Likhaan. I’m really glad I went :)",,"congratulations!

dvvm7ha,Just got an IUD from Likhaan! Thought I’d share my experience,"First of all, thanks for all the posts about Likhaan in this subreddit. It’s where I found out about them, and I’m so glad I did. The people there were super duper nice and friendly.

I got a copper IUD (copper T) just today from the central office of Likhaan Center for Women’s Health, the one in Project 8, Quezon City. Like I mentioned the people were super friendly and accomodating. I was asked to take a quick health questionnaire, that asked some info about my health history, last period, birth control methods I use, and some questions to determine if I was pregnant or not, and I was also given an explanation about the copper T, the side effects with the cramps, how it actually works as a birth control method, etc.

As for the pain, before they inserted the IUD I think they used some stuff to open it up down there and also measure the inside. This was what hurt the most for me. The woman there told me the cramps can be worse for women like me who haven’t had children yet. While they were doing that I had really intense cramps that went on for around 10 minutes. It depends on people’s pain tolerance but personally it hurt quite a lot for me. 

The actual IUD insertion took I think maybe 30 seconds, it hurt a bit but it was over so fast and I didn’t feel it as badly as I expected. The entire time, they were very reassuring, telling me every so often to relax and just take deep breaths. 

The woman also asked where I found out about them and I said it was from Reddit. She said apparently they used to check the Reddit posts about them but haven’t been able to do so lately. I reassured her that it’s all good reviews so she doesn’t have to worry.

I was also very comfortable in the clinic because it was in a residential area that was quiet and peaceful.

OK lang yung pain sakin, I took deep breaths too and went home immediately to rest. Tylenol and a heat compress helped. Then again the experience is different for everybody.

I just wanted to ask if I have to be from a specific income bracket in order to be accommodated by Likhaan? I've read nothing but good reviews about them and I'd really love to get my IUD from them, but I thought that they might just accommodate women from marginalized communities, since that's their ""core"" as a NGO?  I've also heard and read about countless bad experiences with judgmental doctors from private hospitals who refuse to give women IUDs if they're young and/or unmarried, so I'm hoping to avoid all that unnecessary stress and judgment. 

&#x200B;

Also, I just have to say that it's so good to find people like you who share your experiences with these things! A lot of my friends and I (we're in our early 20s) are sexually active and we're pretty open about it, but we do know that there's a lot of judgment outside of our little bubble. It's just really comforting and nice to know that we're not alone and that there are people like you and organizations like Likhaan who aren't afraid to tackle women's health.

dvkh1pj,Just got an IUD from Likhaan! Thought I’d share my experience,"First of all, thanks for all the posts about Likhaan in this subreddit. It’s where I found out about them, and I’m so glad I did. The people there were super duper nice and friendly.

I got a copper IUD (copper T) just today from the central office of Likhaan Center for Women’s Health, the one in Project 8, Quezon City. Like I mentioned the people were super friendly and accomodating. I was asked to take a quick health questionnaire, that asked some info about my health history, last period, birth control methods I use, and some questions to determine if I was pregnant or not, and I was also given an explanation about the copper T, the side effects with the cramps, how it actually works as a birth control method, etc.

As for the pain, before they inserted the IUD I think they used some stuff to open it up down there and also measure the inside. This was what hurt the most for me. The woman there told me the cramps can be worse for women like me who haven’t had children yet. While they were doing that I had really intense cramps that went on for around 10 minutes. It depends on people’s pain tolerance but personally it hurt quite a lot for me. 

The actual IUD insertion took I think maybe 30 seconds, it hurt a bit but it was over so fast and I didn’t feel it as badly as I expected. The entire time, they were very reassuring, telling me every so often to relax and just take deep breaths. 

The woman also asked where I found out about them and I said it was from Reddit. She said apparently they used to check the Reddit posts about them but haven’t been able to do so lately. I reassured her that it’s all good reviews so she doesn’t have to worry.

Also in addition, she told me to advise people to call their clinic first before coming in. She said they had a time period before that people came almost everyday, but the people who do the IUD insertion aren’t in the clinic all the time, they’re only there every other Monday.

I was really worried about experiencing the mood swings and depression side effects I hear about with hormonal birth control methods, since I already have depression I was scared it might make it a lot worse.

Another thing is the longevity of the IUD as well. The woman from Likhaan told me it’s effective for 10-12 years. I can be very forgetful which is why methods that require reminders to take it again/replace it like the pill and the patch wasn’t a good idea for me.

dzblhuf,My experience with getting hormonal contraceptives (Lyndavel),"Hello! I just wanted to share my experience with the Likhaan Center \(an NGO with branches in Manila, Quezon City, and elsewhere in the metro\) and their service of administering hormonal contraceptives. The most well known hormonal contraceptive is probably Implanon, a hormonal implant with an effect that lasts 3 years upon insertion. However, I tense up and sweat bullets at the thought of outpatient surgery, so I decided to go for the alternative the clinician on\-duty offered, which was an injectible called Lyndavel which is administered every 3 months.

According to the clinician \(Ate Chona, whom I'm sure has been mentioned before in other posts about Likhaan\), the effect of Lyndavel is the same as that of Implanon, except, yun nga, I have to come to the clinic every 3 months to get another shot. I'm alright with this arrangement since the clinic is a 15\-minute jeepney ride \+ 10 minute walk from a major mall, which I frequent.

I got my shot last April. After a LOT of Google\-ing for local clinics and their packages for contraceptives, I found out about Likhaan and thought ""wow this is too good to be true"". Setting an appointment with them was as easy as calling their hotline and having the staff inform me of the earliest available appointment date at the branch closest to me. 

I had to wait almost 2 hours for my turn since the patient before me was getting an implant. When it was my turn, the clinician asked me a few questions about my history, commended my S.O. for coming with me \(haha\), and made me fill up a standard patient form. Then, she took 1\-2 minutes to give me the shot. I was in her clinic for less than 15 minutes total. She told me to contact her at a certain date to get my next shot. 

It's been a little over a month now, and here are the side\-effects i've experienced:

*  My period was a week ""late"" \(thought, I have irregular periods to begin with, 1\-2 weeks late is normal for me\)
*  When my period started, I did not experience the intense painful cramps I use to feel. I'm very grateful for this. I had irregular periods, so it would start when I'm least prepared. The intense, painful cramps got in the way of my work. 
*  Continuous, light, irregular spotting since my period started \(2 weeks\). According to Ate Chona, spotting is normal every month. The spotting does not come with cramps.
*  Mild headaches every now and then, notably when I do not eat on time. I deal with these headaches by eating, drinking a lot of water, and Netflix binges.
*  There was one particular day, a week after my period started, that I had mild cramps and INTENSE mood swings. 
*  My appetite has increased **by a lot**. I was a picky eater before getting the shot, and now I'm a picky eater who *MUST* eat what I CRAVE. @\_@ This will likely lead to weight gain if unchecked. Personally, I do not mind gaining weight, but keep this in mind if you plan to get this kind of contraceptive. 

If I could tell my younger college\-self that getting peace of mind was as simple as walking into a clinic and getting a FREE shot \(yes, FREE!!! Perfect for the broke college student!!!\), her eyes would glaze over from a combination of disbelief and relief. I wish I knew about this sooner. But I realized that it takes a lot of courage for the uninformed 20\-something to peel away at the taboos surrounding these types of ""uncommon"" contraceptives.

That's all for now. If you need information on the NGO and clinic I mentioned in this post, feel free to message me and I will give you some comprehensive information. If you're on Lyndavel, I'd like to hear about your experience getting the injection, and the side\-effects too. :\)",presidium,"Thanks for the report, OP.

dzblgoj,My experience with getting hormonal contraceptives (Lyndavel),"Hello! I just wanted to share my experience with the Likhaan Center \(an NGO with branches in Manila, Quezon City, and elsewhere in the metro\) and their service of administering hormonal contraceptives. The most well known hormonal contraceptive is probably Implanon, a hormonal implant with an effect that lasts 3 years upon insertion. However, I tense up and sweat bullets at the thought of outpatient surgery, so I decided to go for the alternative the clinician on\-duty offered, which was an injectible called Lyndavel which is administered every 3 months.

According to the clinician \(Ate Chona, whom I'm sure has been mentioned before in other posts about Likhaan\), the effect of Lyndavel is the same as that of Implanon, except, yun nga, I have to come to the clinic every 3 months to get another shot. I'm alright with this arrangement since the clinic is a 15\-minute jeepney ride \+ 10 minute walk from a major mall, which I frequent.

I got my shot last April. After a LOT of Google\-ing for local clinics and their packages for contraceptives, I found out about Likhaan and thought ""wow this is too good to be true"". Setting an appointment with them was as easy as calling their hotline and having the staff inform me of the earliest available appointment date at the branch closest to me. 

I had to wait almost 2 hours for my turn since the patient before me was getting an implant. When it was my turn, the clinician asked me a few questions about my history, commended my S.O. for coming with me \(haha\), and made me fill up a standard patient form. Then, she took 1\-2 minutes to give me the shot. I was in her clinic for less than 15 minutes total. She told me to contact her at a certain date to get my next shot. 

It's been a little over a month now, and here are the side\-effects i've experienced:

*  My period was a week ""late"" \(thought, I have irregular periods to begin with, 1\-2 weeks late is normal for me\)
*  When my period started, I did not experience the intense painful cramps I use to feel. I'm very grateful for this. I had irregular periods, so it would start when I'm least prepared. The intense, painful cramps got in the way of my work. 
*  Continuous, light, irregular spotting since my period started \(2 weeks\). According to Ate Chona, spotting is normal every month. The spotting does not come with cramps.
*  Mild headaches every now and then, notably when I do not eat on time. I deal with these headaches by eating, drinking a lot of water, and Netflix binges.
*  There was one particular day, a week after my period started, that I had mild cramps and INTENSE mood swings. 
*  My appetite has increased **by a lot**. I was a picky eater before getting the shot, and now I'm a picky eater who *MUST* eat what I CRAVE. @\_@ This will likely lead to weight gain if unchecked. Personally, I do not mind gaining weight, but keep this in mind if you plan to get this kind of contraceptive. 

If I could tell my younger college\-self that getting peace of mind was as simple as walking into a clinic and getting a FREE shot \(yes, FREE!!!

cz8vdml,What should I know about requesting for a copper IUD as emergency contraception in the Philippines?,"I had unprotected sex last Tuesday (January 22) and based on what I read off the internet, I made the decision to take 4 Nordette pills at around lunchtime today. So far, I have had no side effects yet (still on my first dose). Maybe it's because I drank Bonamine an hour before taking the first dose.

Anyway, I heard that copper IUDs are a lot more effective as EC, but I don't have much time. Should I go to my OB-GYN and ask her? Or should I stick with the pills? (Yes, I know I should have gone sooner.) By the way, if I get an appointment tomorrow, will I be able to make it within the 120-hour window? My OB-GYN is available tomorrow at 9am-12nn.

AFAIK Nordette does the job when taken correctly.

As for IUDs, it's more of a continuous contraceptive, rather than only for emergencies. You can have it in you for a couple of years. But from what I know, IUDs are placed when you have your period because that's the time when your cervix is open. You can opt for that if you are sexually active. The Nordette 4x4 pills are an alternative to the morning-after pill, but again if you are sexually active, you can just consume BC pills (But it is recommended to have extra protection during the first few weeks/months muna)",0,t3_42any2,1,r/Philippines,8,621,supporting

Yes, I think that's what I like more about IUDs -- once I choose to use them as a form of EC, I can keep them in there (haha) for a couple of years as my form of birth control.

I don't know, maybe I'm just really paranoid because I'm not experiencing any side effects usually associated with taking Nordette as ECPs (nausea, vomiting, headaches, etc.). Maybe I'll just wait for my second dose and see what happens then. :)

P.S. Oh, by the way, do you know if I can still request for a copper IUD as EC if I already took the two doses of Nordette correctly? Thanks in advance. :)",1,t1_cz8vdml,1,r/Philippines,16,609,supporting

es30k8b,Funny Wikipideia Philippines!,"Has anyone ever looked up English articles about the Philippines on Wikipedia? I remember reading that Filipinos invented the space program, lights, pens, pots and pans, they were the first race to cook food, invent the incubator, the M-16 rifle, and so on. lol

&#x200B;

Now I am reading these and it says the Philippines is conservative, Catholic, there is no birth control, no homosexuals, no pre-marital sex, no cheating on your spouse, no porn, no prostitution, and when people date, it is not loose and easy like in the west, but could take months or years of wooing, singing love songs, writing poetry and so on. lol

&#x200B;

OK, you can buy condoms at any 711. And Filipino girls are whores. Girls will come up to you everywhere in the street and ask to fuck you. Girls will try to fuck you at the store. Fuck you at the mall. Fuck you at work. Fuck you at church. Filipino chicks are horny and will fuck anyone anywhere. lol 

&#x200B;

The Philippines is famous for being a country with the most prostitutes in the world. And the most homosexuals. There are almost no Catholics here. And no morals. People here cheat, steal, rape, murder. Yes, they have that everywhere. But here, it is cultural. In other places it is illegal and immoral. Here it is normal to fuck kids, do drugs, kill your neighbour, rob a foreigner, and blow up a train.

&#x200B;

So who the hell wrote these ridiculous articles? And how have they not been fixed? lol Thank you wikipedia for the laugh!

ebycrap,We fvck up! Condom broke. Need help urgent.,"Soooo me and my lady had some sexy time around 3pm December 15, 2018. (Dstyle) I was about to release it. midway on pulling out, I came on her vaginal opening. Didn't realise that the condom broke. As we looked the head of my penis was exposed and the semen was all over her butt and vaginal opening where the pubic hair resides. We cleaned ourselves with wet wipes then we inspect if there are semen dripping out of her opening but we couldn't see. So I sprayed alcohol on my fingers and wipe it with tissue then I fingered her and tried scoping out if there are semen release inside her vagina. The only thing that cane out of her is a watery clear slime with no smell (vaginal fluid?) (Ovulation?)

We do we do now?
Consult for an ob gyne? Friendly and non judgemental please. If its ok for a schedule of December 17-18, 2018
Ask for ""morning after pill?"" Or any other alternatives.
Wait until miracle do their work for not forming a child.

We are desperate not to have a child for now cause of being fresh grads, financially unstable and family fueds but We would like to have it when we reach our goals.

You post this thread and you want to rely on faith and miracle? I *almost* want to egg you to rely on this irresponsible action.

ec6c0y2,We fvck up! Condom broke. Need help urgent.,"Soooo me and my lady had some sexy time around 3pm December 15, 2018. (Dstyle) I was about to release it. midway on pulling out, I came on her vaginal opening. Didn't realise that the condom broke. As we looked the head of my penis was exposed and the semen was all over her butt and vaginal opening where the pubic hair resides. We cleaned ourselves with wet wipes then we inspect if there are semen dripping out of her opening but we couldn't see. So I sprayed alcohol on my fingers and wipe it with tissue then I fingered her and tried scoping out if there are semen release inside her vagina. The only thing that cane out of her is a watery clear slime with no smell (vaginal fluid?) (Ovulation?)

",pikaonix,"Hi! You can buy Trust or Lady pills at any Watsons or Mercury over the counter with no prescription :) They cost around P40-P50 pesos? Within 5 days after sex she needs to take 4 of the pills at once then after 12 hours 4 more then okay na. She should have her period in around a week after that. Dont mind the instructions in the box since shes taking them as ECP not regular birth control.

Warning though! The side effects can be pretty nasty and it varies from person to person. In my case I was severely noxious and my acne broke out. Though I know some girls with 0 side effects from the pill, those are the lucky ones!

",qrtraftrone,"First of all, there are no morning-after pills available in the Philippines that are legal. If you Google it, it’ll lead you to posts (like the one on the sidebar of this sub) about taking certain birth control pills, 4 now and 4 12 hours after. **BUT** that can be dangerous, and would advise you visit an ob-gyn first. Though it seems you aren’t going to. So now consider what happened. If “her boyfriend barely put the tip in” then there’s a big chance she’s fine. Also consider her fertility, which is approximately 14 days (+/- a few days) after the first day of her last menstrual period if she has a regular cycle. Hopefully the paranoia will teach her a lesson not to do it again. ",0,t3_7pf0n0,3,r/Philippines,4,689,supporting

We decided to buy Trust pill. (45hours na nakalipas since the last deed happen) 4 take sa 12nn then 4 take sa 12 midnight. Tapos ang effect ay di siya makatulog, masakit ang tyan, naduduwal at nahihilo. Hindi na niya kaya indahin ang sakit at nagdecide siya na uminom ng Kremil S.

Ano pong possible effect nun sa ECP? Gagana pa din po ba ito?",RemindMeBot,"I will be messaging you on [**2019-09-17 23:14:04 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2019-09-17 23:14:04 UTC To Local Time) to remind you of [**this link.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/a741m5/trust_pill_effect_and_taking_kremil_s/)

Taken altogether, the census data and the registered births data show that we've probably already hit peak child a few years ago, meaning there will never be more Filipino children than there are today.

2. As a person you should be able to get condoms at any age as long as the age of legal consent is available. 
3. People who tell card you for condoms are about as dumb as those who card for buying a small amount of medicine such as a strip of aspirin or AlkaSeltzer.

Strange isn't it. People post on Reddit and other people give their opinions about the best course of action. I'd suggest that if you want to make statements and be protected against the nasty opinions of others, you make a blog without the ability for viewers to post comments, then the big bad world won't come along and make you cry with all these nasty opinions.

>  I simply find that disgusting and arrogant as if you know better about her situation than her and everyone else.

You find someone having an opinion to be disgusting and arrogant, but you're arrogant enough to think your opinion is the only one that counts? Yeah, right bro - good luck with that.

Yesterday I watched this very shocking video: [https://youtu.be/r5cli6FRsAs](https://youtu.be/r5cli6FRsAs)

&#x200B;

IT revealed how hundreds of thousands of women have illegal unsanitary abortions done in the Philippines due to the procedure being highly illegal there. How even if the women's life is at stake, she's forbidden to have an abortion done. How this leads to many girls deaths in the country.

&#x200B;

My specific question is, how can we claim we are good Christians if we are denying women access to birth control, forcing them to have unwanted babies (when they are rape victims) and letting them die when medical reasons prevent them from surviving a pregnancy? Surely this is not humane?",TheLastManetheren,"It is. You value the new ""life"" but discard the mother's health. Perhaps it is viewed upon as selfishness on the mum's side to think of herself because the child is still innocent etc.",1,t1_et90uwb,7,r/Philippines,4,184,supporting

#Marcos

>Duterte intends to allow late dictator Ferdinand Marcos to be buried at a cemetery for national heroes, saying this will help end decades of social division over the issue. But human rights victims say this will help whitewash the dictator’s crimes.

- Done, and the Marcos name is continually being normalized, and their atrocities being wrongfully justified and excused.

#Opening up to foreign investment

>Duterte is in favour of changing the constitution to lift restrictive foreign investment laws. Duterte told telcos to improve one of the region’s slowest internet connections or face competition from foreign players. But he is opposed to foreign ownership of land.

- Duterte has secured loans and investment pledges from Japan, China and other countries.
- [Some of these loans and investments might have overly high interest rates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anderscorr/2017/05/13/new-philippine-debt-of-167-billion-could-balloon-to-452-billion-china-will-benefit/)

#China ties

>After relations with China plummeted during Aquino’s term over a South China Sea territorial dispute, Duterte has said he wants ""friendly"" ties with Beijing. Aquino refused to hold direct negotiations with China over the maritime dispute, but Duterte is open to one-on-one talks. He is also courting Chinese investment in infrastructure.

Recap, did you take 4 pills for the first dose & another 4 after 12hrs? As long as you do this within 24 hrs, I think you're good. It's more dangerous if you weren't able to take it immediately. I'm pretty sure the bleeding is the meds doing its job, but to be sure after it's over, wait for your actual period. Or take a test (but I've never done that).

I'd like to tell you now that if you're active, consider taking them on the daily, because using ecp too frequently has unknown side effects. I've heard it decreases your lifespan but I'm not too sure about it. But so far, Trust hasn't failed me but I've learned not to rely on it. Practice safe sex! 😊

If contraception is not your main reason for consulting a gyne, you may openly discuss with her the irregularity of your menstrual cycle, your dysmenorrhea and your mom's PCOS history. You can ask her if she will recommend combined OCPs for you or she may as well suggest what would be the management for your case. 
So my suggestions for you are:
1. Ask among your closest or trusted friends or relatives who would be a reliable gyne in your area and obviously you should save up for it; and
2. A lot of OCPs will seriously be off the market by the end of 2020 (which is seriously bothering me as I myself am on the pill). I am currently on Althea, a combined OCP, which is still available over the counter. A 21 pill pack costs around 400 something pesos, if I may recall correctly.

",Teantis,"Diane is still available.  When I was first dating my wife I actually went with her to the OB and was in the room because she was too nervous to do it on her own (this was in that clinic up top in GB5) and a few things:

1. It was fairly cheap, less than 1000 pesos for the consultation if i remember correctly I wanna say 600 but I'm not sure.
2. He was nice, no judgey faces or anything just like 'ok yeah sure'
3. He didn't do anything, no examination or review of medical history or anything.  He just wrote a prescription
4.  You don't need a prescription to buy it here.  I go and buy my wife's BC at mercury all the time.

Still you should go see an OB for an actual checkup every year starting from the time you're 18.  Shit can go wrong.  My friend just had two cysts removed from her uterus at 29 years old, just to make sure they didn't develop into anything else.  That's the sorta shit you only catch at a checkup.  By the time you're feeling funny, or noticing something and hauling yourself to the doctor, it might have already developed to something much worse than it could've been.  ""an ounce of prevention is greater than a pound of cure"" and all that.  

Also if any health worker giving you 'tude about you making your decisions about your body, they can fuck right off.  Some do do it though (less so in the fancy clinics like in GB5 than in less sosyal ones in my experience), but it's not the majority.  Though I've found when you ask for STD tests is when you get the most bullshit.  When they did that to me I just stank eyed them right back, because that's me doing my civic duty as well as taking care of my health right there. Ok end PSA.

They *discourage* giving IUD's to those who aren't married because there is a higher chance na magkaSTI ka and yung bacteria/virus na nag ca-cause ng STI pwede umakyat sa uterus mo through the string. 

Another reason is masyadong maliit yung uterus ng mga di pa nabubuntis and baka mabutas yung uterus mo in the process. Although kung pasok yung measurement ng uterus mo, ibibigay naman nila. Kung masyadong maliit kasi pwede mabutas yung uterus mo during the insertion. Also, you must be sexually active kasi lalagyan ka ng speculum during the process \[plus you need to check the strings every after period and that means pushing fingers down there\] and mahihirapan sila kung di ka marunong mag control ng muscles mo, lalagyan ka parin naman kung hindi pero again, di advisable.

>You've never been pregnant  
>  
>You're not married (not really important PERO they're making sure na maliit lang yung chance mo for STIs therefore, dapat minimal lang partners mo)

During the insertion process \[based from my experience, I have a high pain threshold\], ang masakit lang naman is yung pag stretch ng speculum. Yung mismong measurement \[yung may ipapasok sila sa cervix mo para imeasure\] di masakit, uncomfortable lang. One tip is to relax everything, every muscle you have in that area kasi if you contract your muscles mas sasakit siya. I can't tell anything about insertion kasi my uterus was too small for the IUD so I opted for the implant instead. BTW, they give out copper IUDs, di hormonal.  
Another option kung gusto mo talaga ng long term na BC pero di ka sexually active is the implant (3 years, pero babalik ka 1 month after insertion) and Depo shot (3 months then babalik), both would be great for you kasi di ka sexually active and tuok lang naman yan, the the implant needing more attention \[not care, unlike the IUD\] than the shot.

Even if the most obvious solution to the problem is making contraceptives more readily available, many people don't want to acknowledge that premarital sex happens. Because according to their religion, it's a sin. And distributing contraceptives is encouraging that sin.

It's not just the regular people, many of our lawmakers are quite conservative as well. Boxer and senator (...sigh) Manny Pacquiao is a good example.

They're likely sugarcoating it. Teenage pregnancy is embarrassing to the community and the families of the couple stand to lose face. So they use euphemisms here.

>as I might not be seeing the big picture. Thanks

What you need to understand that overall, Filipinos act like little children around issues of sex and sexuality. They treat it as an icky thing that is done only to have children. The common position there is that sex education should be done by the parents alone. The problem is that the parents likely don't know because they weren't taught properly either. Even if they were, they don't want to, because it's embarrassing. In short, they beat around the bush because heaven help you say ""penis"" and ""vagina"".

So that leaves the children stuck in a sea of ignorance, where they could fall victim to common falsehoods (e.g. no risk of pregnancy if you pull out early), or the internet, or porn. That will be the basis of their knowledge on sex.

It also does not help that religious groups have a massive influence on thinking here. Influence that says ""no way, no how"" to anything contraceptive, even if it's just knowing that they are a thing.

No matter how much Doktor or Doktora or Nars will say otherwise, Filipinos would rather listen to their priest or their family members, who may or know what to do, but likely don't.",0,t3_8q8rex,6,r/Philippines,0,1454,supporting

c5mo2ne,Pro-RH Bill,"I personally think that the RH bill is a *great* idea.

Filipinos *need* access to contraception and sexual education. To clarify, I’m Christian, and I am pro-life. Though, living in America has made me respect the separation of church and state, my arguments for pro-life are not entirely religious. No disrespect meant towards them, but there are way too many people my age (even younger) and those not too much older than us who have had unplanned pregnancies. Kudos to them for not aborting them, but a lot of these teen mothers just leave their kids to their parents or yayas and continue to get wasted every Friday night.

I don’t think the Scripture is against contraception. I think the Pope is. You can’t pick and choose what parts of the Bible are true in order to favor your views. Yes, a man and woman were meant to reproduce, but not all men and women will. Also, the verses “against” contraception are from the Old Testament. A lot of the rules in the Old Testament need to be understood in context. During biblical times, family lineage is most important. Women are devalued and their only purpose is to create children—nothing else. That’s why rapists were required to marry their victims; no one would marry a non-virgin, so she is given a husband, etc.

So many of these “rules” are no longer followed in modern society because we’re just that—modern society. It’s against these rules to wear different kinds of fabrics at the same time, to be near a woman when she’s on her period, and to wear clothes of the opposite sex. Abortion is wrong, and proper contraception is good. In my opinion, sex outside of marriage is wrong. Yes, the Bible also says that, but to me, it’s also because in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, you’re not mature enough to care for a child (especially when you’re just out partying). Being a bastard myself, I understand how unplanned pregnancies can ruin the lives of those who aren’t ready to be parents. When my parents had me, their baby shower gifts were sex toys when baby shower gifts are supposed to be diapers, baby clothes, etc, to help the family because babies cost a lot, etc.

Also, life begins at *conception*. Conception = mama egg is fertilized by papa sperm. Apparently it’s such a bad thing that the sperm doesn’t meet the egg, but do people not realize how many times a day a guy ejaculates… There are *so many* benefits to contraception, not just avoiding unplanned babies. The birth control has a lot of health benefits for women (period stuff, skin stuff, etc).

Overpopulation is a BAD thing. Overpopulation = poverty. China “makes everything” because of cheap labor (yes, that’s a bad thing, too). They’re actually not well off economically.

The RH Bill is not a “HEY LET ME SHOVE THIS IN YOUR FACE DO THIS DO THAT ETC” deal. It’s free choice.

Filipinos *need* access to contraception and sexual education. To clarify, I’m Christian, and I am pro-life. Though, living in America has made me respect the separation of church and state, my arguments for pro-life are not entirely religious. No disrespect meant towards them, but there are way too many people my age (even younger) and those not too much older than us who have had unplanned pregnancies. Kudos to them for not aborting them, but a lot of these teen mothers just leave their kids to their parents or yayas and continue to get wasted every Friday night.

I don’t think the Scripture is against contraception. I think the Pope is. You can’t pick and choose what parts of the Bible are true in order to favor your views. Yes, a man and woman were meant to reproduce, but not all men and women will. Also, the verses “against” contraception are from the Old Testament. A lot of the rules in the Old Testament need to be understood in context. During biblical times, family lineage is most important. Women are devalued and their only purpose is to create children—nothing else. That’s why rapists were required to marry their victims; no one would marry a non-virgin, so she is given a husband, etc.

So many of these “rules” are no longer followed in modern society because we’re just that—modern society. It’s against these rules to wear different kinds of fabrics at the same time, to be near a woman when she’s on her period, and to wear clothes of the opposite sex. Abortion is wrong, and proper contraception is good. In my opinion, sex outside of marriage is wrong. Yes, the Bible also says that, but to me, it’s also because in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, you’re not mature enough to care for a child (especially when you’re just out partying). Being a bastard myself, I understand how unplanned pregnancies can ruin the lives of those who aren’t ready to be parents. When my parents had me, their baby shower gifts were sex toys when baby shower gifts are supposed to be diapers, baby clothes, etc, to help the family because babies cost a lot, etc.

Also, life begins at *conception*. Conception = mama egg is fertilized by papa sperm. Apparently it’s such a bad thing that the sperm doesn’t meet the egg, but do people not realize how many times a day a guy ejaculates… There are *so many* benefits to contraception, not just avoiding unplanned babies. The birth control has a lot of health benefits for women (period stuff, skin stuff, etc).

Overpopulation is a BAD thing. Overpopulation = poverty. China “makes everything” because of cheap labor (yes, that’s a bad thing, too). They’re actually not well off economically.

Wikipedia has a truly excellent analysis of the issues surrounding this question: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beginning_of_human_personhood

I really do commend you on your idealism. But again, the RH Bill is an unproven solution to a well known problem. I have no flack with the promiscuity issue per se, because the hell I care with what they do in their bedrooms. 

>But it doesn't matter whether you're rich or poor;
But it does. It really does. The rich has a wider access to media and resources than the poor. The rich has more opportunities for women in terms of higher education, job opportunities, and even leaders in their own household.

Stop being so patronizing and respect the people as thinking ones. They don't need education at all. Education can be provided within the curriculum. And would you expect the same people who aren't under the education system to be under the RH Bill's wings of hope?

Please.

>So are you saying the government should continue to keep people in the dark in terms of sex education?

No. Also, I don't appreciate you twisting what I'm saying. If the women are empowered, they will be part of the decision making in terms of ""family planning."" The knowledge is not ""forced"" but rather encouraged in a more effective way. RH Bill only tells people that ""hey the government is here to be your savior"" which really is turning us into a welfare-for-the-poor state. While the middle class and the rich continue to pay skyrocket taxes, the poor gets their slice from something they never contributed to.

And I don't think that's an effective way to go about it. I think, a wholistic policy, one that will benefit all by empowering the women and making them part of the workforce, and not just the ""taga-laba ni aling X"" or ""tagabantay ng tindahan ni aling Y.""

Take a look at the war in Mindanao [sex-strike](http://ontd-political.livejournal.com/8702462.html). The women were so empowered that they were agents of change. IF the women of the poor are also empowered, then the men will not be so forceful, and the women will actually be the one to buy the condom herself, which, not to mention, will be a boom to our condom industry.

Yes, a man and woman were meant to reproduce, but not all men and women will. Also, the verses “against” contraception are from the Old Testament. A lot of the rules in the Old Testament need to be understood in context. During biblical times, family lineage is most important. Women are devalued and their only purpose is to create children—nothing else. That’s why rapists were required to marry their victims; no one would marry a non-virgin, so she is given a husband, etc.

So many of these “rules” are no longer followed in modern society because we’re just that—modern society. It’s against these rules to wear different kinds of fabrics at the same time, to be near a woman when she’s on her period, and to wear clothes of the opposite sex. Abortion is wrong, and proper contraception is good. In my opinion, sex outside of marriage is wrong. Yes, the Bible also says that, but to me, it’s also because in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, you’re not mature enough to care for a child (especially when you’re just out partying). Being a bastard myself, I understand how unplanned pregnancies can ruin the lives of those who aren’t ready to be parents. When my parents had me, their baby shower gifts were sex toys when baby shower gifts are supposed to be diapers, baby clothes, etc, to help the family because babies cost a lot, etc.

Also, life begins at *conception*. Conception = mama egg is fertilized by papa sperm. Apparently it’s such a bad thing that the sperm doesn’t meet the egg, but do people not realize how many times a day a guy ejaculates… There are *so many* benefits to contraception, not just avoiding unplanned babies. The birth control has a lot of health benefits for women (period stuff, skin stuff, etc).

Overpopulation is a BAD thing. Overpopulation = poverty. China “makes everything” because of cheap labor (yes, that’s a bad thing, too). They’re actually not well off economically.

The RH Bill is not a “HEY LET ME SHOVE THIS IN YOUR FACE DO THIS DO THAT ETC” deal. It’s free choice.

Condoms are NOT the cause of the spread of AIDS (see what happens when you lack sex education?). They actually prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.

No disrespect meant towards them, but there are way too many people my age (even younger) and those not too much older than us who have had unplanned pregnancies.

eb1bkpu,Your Complete Guide To Birth Control Methods In The Philippines,,Poppun_,"See the problem is these goals go beyond what even the WDI: Sustainable Development Goals tries to accomplish. 

So let me elaborate:
Zero pregnancies before graduating University or Vocational school (what you mean to say was unintended pregnancies; pregnancy before Uni isn't an issue, some people may want to have children after HS that's their choice. Furthermore, reduction is the only realistic goal no such this as zero pregnancies)
 
Zero abortions (why zero abortions? This is not a birth control question this is a legislative question. Personally, I am for abortions, women should have that choice)

Less than 3 children per mother (how exactly do you plan to enforce this? A policy similar to the One Child Policy? Not to mention how arbitrary that is)

Birth spacing of 2-5 years (another thing that isn't enforceable; also what exactly is the basis for 2-5 years?)

So I guess my point is, these ""goals"" are not only unrealistic but they're also in a morally grey area.

[Here's my overview of them and where you can get them in this country.](https://childfreefilipina.wordpress.com/2015/01/22/a-general-overview-of-birth-control-methods/).

* Depo-Provera (the shot) -- available in most OB-GYNE clinics. It costs about 500 PHP, and you have to get a shot every three months. In that respect, it's not very ""long term"". My single/unmarried friends have been able to get this with no problem. 94% effective.
* Nexplanon, Implanon (implants) -- I personally don't know anyone who has this, but I know it costs anywhere from free in barangay clinics to 10,000 PHP in private clinics. It's good for 3 years and has the highest effectivity of all current BC methods (99.9%).
* Mirena (hormonal IUD) -- this costs about 5000 PHP and is good for 5 years. 99+% effective. As with all long-term hormonal methods, she might eventually stop having periods. Getting an IUD is a hassle though, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're brave/ super dedicated to all this. [Here's my post about that.](https://childfreefilipina.wordpress.com/2015/01/23/i-finally-got-an-iud/)
* ParaGard (non-hormonal IUD) -- this costs about 2500 PHP and is good for 12 years. 99% effective. Causes heavier periods. This is the one I have, coupled with BC pills because the 1% margin of error still freaks me out.

Life pro tip: If she doesn't have an OB-GYNE yet, don't just walk in. Call ahead and ask if the doctor prescribes BC methods for single/unmarried women.

Yes, also that. May kamahalan din kasi contraception eh. Kung yung kakainin mo nga pinoproblema mo, yung pang-sex mo pa kaya?

And to answer your questions (well, they won't answer all of them, anyway) :

1. Because as married couples, sex just *happens*. 

2. Yeah sex means a possibility to have kids, but many of them do NOT even know that there are options to *not* have kids.

3. A lot of the poor are still kinda gullible to the Church and its teachings. If the Church says ""Birth control is bad and you should feel bad"" then they're goddamn follow what the Church says. 

4. If you're coming from a place where opportunities to study, you'll likely end up doing ""low-tier"" jobs (for the lack of a better term). Even kids can work for their families. Therefore more people in your household = more sources of income, so to speak. E.g., sibling 1 works as a kargador to help sibling 2's studies, but sibling 2 needs to sell sampaguita on the side so mama can buy sibling 3's baby formula etc. etc. 

Basically a lot of it boils down to lack of education, especially sex education. 

Sadly in this staunchly-Catholic country talking about sex is taboo out of a slippery-slope fear that if people talk about sex they'll be having more sex - and that's bad because sex ""is supposed to be sacred"". And if you gave these people ways to have sex without getting pregnant, then they'll be having even *more* sex! And that's the kind of BS our church leaders feed the population and the poor gobble it right up. 

It's pretty obvious that you learn a lot in school - from ABCs to the birds and the bees, and *especially* critical thinking and long-term planning. If you don't have access to that - well you can get a clue without studying, but it's going to be much harder than if you've had anyone teaching you how to. And even then our educational system is still shit.

(and this is why our *masa* is gullible to the vote-buying efforts of running politicians who steal from their pockets, anyways) 

Which is why I'm supporting Responsible Parenting and sex education in public schools tbh. More people can have access to *learning* more about their bodies, and have actual *access to birth control* - both things that have been denied to them due to their poverty.

Contraceptives are probably available for free in health centers. And it's kinda hard to hold people responsible if they're not aware of their options in the first place. The same people probably belong in a socio-economic bracket where planning simply means finding something to eat daily.

So my gf takes pills because of her polycystic ovaries. She takes them regularly because they the doctor prescribed them to help regulate her menstral cycle, and because she also does not want to get pregnant. However, to our surprise, it seems she got pregnant even while on the pill.

We tried consulting with an OB, and she simply told us that contraceptives are not 100% effective. We asked what we should do to solve this, but she sad she couldn't recommend us anything. Aside from this, with my gf's condition, she believes we actually got lucky. Even if we were trying, it would have been very hard for us to concieve, and we actually did it without actively trying. And this difficulty would increase as we got older, so we actually should try to concieve as early as possible. Her personal opinion was we should be thanking our stars.

After a long conversation, and even with the seemingly biased opinion of the OB, my gf decided not to keep it. 

After a bit of research, we found that the best way to do this is by using Misoprostol and Mifepristone. Do you know any pharmacies where we can get this without a prescription?

",vonbrynhilde,"i have a different case. My girlfriend used Trust Pills as ECP(8pill ecp) after taking the first 4 pills. She started bleeding after 2hours. she's due to have her period around 15-20 of july (it's the 11th when she took it.) and it's the first time she took a birth control pill. I'm really worried thats its something serious cause ive tried reading about this 8-pill ecp and they normally have their bleeding 5-7 days after taking the pills. My girlfriend had hers 2hours after taking the pill. I'm trying to rule things out.

(she's bleeding heavily like shes on her period but the color is pinkish)

a)if the pill already messed up her menstrual cycle and made it a week earlier.

b)if its breakthrough bleeding? cause its her first time.

Im really scared that it wont work. So please help me rule things out. She took the trust pills on the 4th day after the deed.",0,t3_80c4ku,1,r/Philippines,8,878,supporting

On my first take, i drank 2 yellow 2 brown pills. On my second take, i drank 3 yellow and 1 brown pill.

Will they still be effective even if the brown pill is ""inactive""??

",candymiles,"Ovulation is the time when the ovary release its egg to meet the sperm. On a typical 28-day cycle, it’s ovulation day is the 14th (half way), so if the woman’s cycle is longer or shorter than the 28cycle, just add or subtract the days. In determining the fertile window of the woman, the day of her ovulation (14th day), count 5 days before, that is the start of her fertility window. Example her ovulation is on the 24th, so 24-5 = 19. So the date 19 is the start of her fertile window. Don’t have sex on these days till ovulation day. Plus, 2-3days after ovulation. So the equation is now the 19th-26th.. don’t have sex on these days to be safe from pregnancy. Usually a woman’s typical cycle has 7-8 days fertility window.  Hope this helps.

ep3bzfl,Shame on most doctors in the Philippines,"I would like to share here how the doctors in your country treat their own people in the worst possible way. This is one of the stories I have.  


My employee which is 19 and female had sex with her boyfriend and the condom broke. She came out to me for help. Me living in a normal country where people have choice (even abortion is legal, i do not agree with abortion unless specific cases), I advise her to visit the Ob-gyn doctor. She lives in a municipality 80 kilometers from a bigger city. She goes to the hospital in the municipality and the doctor is on leave and after 12 PM no doctor is available anymore. Next normal thing to do is to ask her to go to the bigger city, which is 2 hours travel. Of course, in a 250,000 inhabitants, no Ob-gyn doctor available in that specific moment and she has to return. Thinking of what is better, I ask her to try all the pharmacies to look for Plan B (emergency contraception) pills, but all the pharmacists did not even know what Plan B means, did not even understand the words 'emergency contraception', asking her what is that. After I search a little in Google I find out that there is no such thing in the Philippines and pharmacies are not allow to sell. I wonder though what kind of school those pharmacists attend, that they do not know what ""levonorgestrel"" means, because once you give this name, they are supposed to tell you what are the drugs available containing this substance. Maybe the school they attend is 'enjoy fiesta and eating lechon baboy' ?  


  
Researching more in the internet I find some open minded filipino website describing the available birth control pills in the Philippines and which can be substituted for Plan B and I found Trust pills which cost like 50 pesos for a pack. She gets 4 pills and then after 12 hours another 4 pills and decides to stay on the pill. It was supposedly her first day of menstruation anyways. I still advised to see a doctor, she tries again in her municipality but the doctor is 'on leave'.. I did not hear such term about a doctor.  


  
Next day when she is going there at 8 AM she is sent home as there were only 15 people in a day allowed. One more day is passing and she goes there at 7.30 AM and the nurse at entrance guides her to a room where there is a midwife and the doctor. Only 2 girls waiting in front of her. She has no signal in that place and we cannot communicate. After 3 hours she exits the hospital and I ask her what happened. She says that the doctor is completely ignoring her, she is only talking to the midwife. She needs to explain her case in front of another 17 girls some of them knowing her. They even ask her to tell the name of the guy. Doctor continues to ignore her and they ask her to attend some course, about danger signs in pregnancy which she started to attend. She is only able to talk a little to the midwife which advises she will get a pregnancy test.  


Now the big fuck up. When you become a doctor, you agree to keep the secret about the patient. You also agree that you will do your best to save his life. If you don't do this, you are NOT WORTH to be a doctor. Her case is so private and other people are not supposed to know about this but she needs to explain herself in front of other 17 women which says it shames her so much. She even had to pay 200 pesos for this. I wish I am there and I would just go inside and take her out and scream at the doctor and also go to report the scam to the police as she did not receive any checkup from the doctor for the money she paid.  


Is there any place where this can be reported ?  


Another case similar to this is when her mother has a swollen arm and they go to the big city to be attended by a doctor, even they have money, there is no way that they get to any doctor. No one is paying attention to them even in big hospitals that are newly built. One of the big hospital that has so much advertising has no doctor inside, only nurses ! For God's sake, what is happening to the doctors in the Philippines ? Where are they ? What are they ? Monsters ?  


Another bad story is when someone is sick and they are not admitted in the hospital unless they will prove having enough money, like 20000 php at least. He is left to die at the gate of the hospital and of course he died. SHAME ON YOU PIECES OF SHIT THAT YOU DO THAT. Even in Africa you will be admitted if you have an emergency.

What do you want the doctor to do? Extract the semen inside her? You already said she had taken the pills already. And its not that critical of a situation for her to be given special attention to.

And for god sake its obvious that what happened was that other patients there simply ask her “hey what are you here for?” and she blabbered it herself.

Next day when she is going there at 8 AM she is sent home as there were only 15 people in a day allowed. One more day is passing and she goes there at 7.30 AM and the nurse at entrance guides her to a room where there is a midwife and the doctor. Only 2 girls waiting in front of her. She has no signal in that place and we cannot communicate. After 3 hours she exits the hospital and I ask her what happened. She says that the doctor is completely ignoring her, she is only talking to the midwife. She needs to explain her case in front of another 17 girls some of them knowing her. They even ask her to tell the name of the guy. Doctor continues to ignore her and they ask her to attend some course, about danger signs in pregnancy which she started to attend. She is only able to talk a little to the midwife which advises she will get a pregnancy test.  


Now the big fuck up. When you become a doctor, you agree to keep the secret about the patient. You also agree that you will do your best to save his life. If you don't do this, you are NOT WORTH to be a doctor.

She even had to pay 200 pesos for this. I wish I am there and I would just go inside and take her out and scream at the doctor and also go to report the scam to the police as she did not receive any checkup from the doctor for the money she paid.  


Is there any place where this can be reported ?  


Another case similar to this is when her mother has a swollen arm and they go to the big city to be attended by a doctor, even they have money, there is no way that they get to any doctor. No one is paying attention to them even in big hospitals that are newly built. One of the big hospital that has so much advertising has no doctor inside, only nurses ! For God's sake, what is happening to the doctors in the Philippines ? Where are they ? What are they ? Monsters ?  


Another bad story is when someone is sick and they are not admitted in the hospital unless they will prove having enough money, like 20000 php at least.

There is the story people spread.

Your posting on the say so of a 19 year old and some stories you have heard like these things are facts.

I very, very much doubt that and story you ever hear here is true and never believe a word of someone unless u see it for yourself.

Now as for DRs here, do u have any idea the dumb fucking shit they hear, see and have to put up with every single day?  Let alone the ten years of study and training plus the additional 3 to 5 years of training to specilize in their chosen fields, in under funded, under staffed and over worked conditions.

Point 1 and 3. I know very well that abortion is illegal, i was not complaining of that at all. Doctors are nowhere to be found in a 250000 inhabitants city. So how can doctors have 10 day straight duties when they will take a break and leave going home at 12, after staying at work for 4 hours ? That is the norm in her place.  


Also I complain about the quality of these doctors. A doctor in big hospital in Manila, is giving as advice after a child had Dengue, to not eat anything that is dark colored. Any normal doctor would laugh at this advice. This advice is more like a quack doctor. I ask my doctor in my country and said that probably the doctor advising that has some mental problem.  


By the way, I almost died in the Philippines because of a simple ear infection and also almost died with dengue. I have never been so close to death as in the Philippines, twice in 3 years. Also I have never seen so many people dying around me in 3 years, as the rest of 37 years of my life. Probably 5 times more people dead in those 3 years.

She has no signal in that place and we cannot communicate. After 3 hours she exits the hospital and I ask her what happened. She says that the doctor is completely ignoring her, she is only talking to the midwife. She needs to explain her case in front of another 17 girls some of them knowing her. They even ask her to tell the name of the guy. Doctor continues to ignore her and they ask her to attend some course, about danger signs in pregnancy which she started to attend. She is only able to talk a little to the midwife which advises she will get a pregnancy test.  


Now the big fuck up. When you become a doctor, you agree to keep the secret about the patient. You also agree that you will do your best to save his life. If you don't do this, you are NOT WORTH to be a doctor. Her case is so private and other people are not supposed to know about this but she needs to explain herself in front of other 17 women which says it shames her so much. She even had to pay 200 pesos for this. I wish I am there and I would just go inside and take her out and scream at the doctor and also go to report the scam to the police as she did not receive any checkup from the doctor for the money she paid.  


Is there any place where this can be reported ?  


Another case similar to this is when her mother has a swollen arm and they go to the big city to be attended by a doctor, even they have money, there is no way that they get to any doctor. No one is paying attention to them even in big hospitals that are newly built. One of the big hospital that has so much advertising has no doctor inside, only nurses ! For God's sake, what is happening to the doctors in the Philippines ? Where are they ? What are they ? Monsters ?

The gynecologist ignored her completely. She put her to describe what she did in front of many other girls and there was no consultation at all. This is the real truth and nothing else, she is not lying to me as she really has NO REAL REASON. She is getting a lot of money from me for her hard work, I am her employer and she could not get any money if she lied about this.

Then when she was with her mother in Tacloban City, her mother had her elbow and foot swollen and having a bad allergic reaction. They are not able to find a doctor WHOLE DAY and I was on call with her when she is talking to the guards or nurses at the hospital. Not even 1 million pesos would have brought a doctor for her mother ! The staff in the hospital was unhelpful at all and many times even rude. Doctors take very much often vacations and not go to work, including dentists.

While I was in Dipolog City, I was having Dengue fever and at the hospital everyone was ignoring me. They did not even look at me. Also when I had a bad ear infection, the regular doctor which lives near prescribed me the wrong antibiotics as the ear doctor was in vacation. My ex-wife in that time forbid me (yes, forbid me, she was a fucking liar pinay, thirsty of money, controlling and very jealous) to go to another city to visit the ENT doctor and she said I could wait another 3 weeks until doctor would come back. She said practically to walk it off. I think I was lucky that the infection did not reach the brain... as I was not able to move my head in the last stage and also could barely see with my right eye. I was practically a prisoner there and had people to report to her after following me in the street watching every of my move. This is how some people think there, like her, like the idiot gynecologist or like many others that think it is fine to treat others like subhuman.

Maybe your significant other is different, but it might be the 1 % that is different. Also the one being ignored in the hospital was a pregnant mother and they just let her die, no doctor came to see her, it happened in Dipolog City, government hospital, it is not something that I heard, it was happening while I was there.

I can bet not 100 $ but I can bet 1 million that what happened is real, you just wrongly assume that everyone is a liar. If you are a liar there is no need to assume that everyone is a liar, because that is just the norm for many people there..",1,t1_ep553ls,1,r/Philippines,8,2492,supporting

My employee which is 19 and female had sex with her boyfriend and the condom broke. She came out to me for help. Me living in a normal country where people have choice (even abortion is legal, i do not agree with abortion unless specific cases), I advise her to visit the Ob-gyn doctor. She lives in a municipality 80 kilometers from a bigger city. She goes to the hospital in the municipality and the doctor is on leave and after 12 PM no doctor is available anymore. Next normal thing to do is to ask her to go to the bigger city, which is 2 hours travel. Of course, in a 250,000 inhabitants, no Ob-gyn doctor available in that specific moment and she has to return. Thinking of what is better, I ask her to try all the pharmacies to look for Plan B (emergency contraception) pills, but all the pharmacists did not even know what Plan B means, did not even understand the words 'emergency contraception', asking her what is that. After I search a little in Google I find out that there is no such thing in the Philippines and pharmacies are not allow to sell. I wonder though what kind of school those pharmacists attend, that they do not know what ""levonorgestrel"" means, because once you give this name, they are supposed to tell you what are the drugs available containing this substance. Maybe the school they attend is 'enjoy fiesta and eating lechon baboy' ?  


  
Researching more in the internet I find some open minded filipino website describing the available birth control pills in the Philippines and which can be substituted for Plan B and I found Trust pills which cost like 50 pesos for a pack. She gets 4 pills and then after 12 hours another 4 pills and decides to stay on the pill. It was supposedly her first day of menstruation anyways. I still advised to see a doctor, she tries again in her municipality but the doctor is 'on leave'.. I did not hear such term about a doctor.

Firstly if you live in but fuck no where then yes medical care is going to be sub par.  Every single local knows that if you want good medical care you need to go to larger cities.

This is a fact in any 3rd world country and even more so with the disaster that leyte still has not recovered from to this day.

When you go to Hospital here you need to bring a local with you.  This is what ever locals do as there is a lot of running around that needs to be done and the sick can not do it, this is how things are here.

The public hospitals in this country are under staffed, over run and under funded. 

As a Foreigner you go to a private hospital, PERIOD.

Partly because you will get better service and mostly so you do not add to the already over worked under manned public hospitals.

If you want better medical treatment then move to a larger city. 
Diplog city is a 3rd class city. with just over 100 thousand people living in it. This means it is a small ass city that is probably not used to dealing with foreigners.

Now as for vacations.  DR's deserve vacations and get about 4 weeks worth a year.  Is it their fault you went there while they were on vacation?

Is it a Dr's fault there is not enough Drs, or staff to accommodate you in a public hospital? 

I am just giving you a heads up on someone that has been here for a very long time, both in the province and out of it and all your complaints stem from being in rural areas.

I still advised to see a doctor, she tries again in her municipality but the doctor is 'on leave'.. I did not hear such term about a doctor.  


  
Next day when she is going there at 8 AM she is sent home as there were only 15 people in a day allowed. One more day is passing and she goes there at 7.30 AM and the nurse at entrance guides her to a room where there is a midwife and the doctor. Only 2 girls waiting in front of her. She has no signal in that place and we cannot communicate. After 3 hours she exits the hospital and I ask her what happened. She says that the doctor is completely ignoring her, she is only talking to the midwife. She needs to explain her case in front of another 17 girls some of them knowing her. They even ask her to tell the name of the guy. Doctor continues to ignore her and they ask her to attend some course, about danger signs in pregnancy which she started to attend. She is only able to talk a little to the midwife which advises she will get a pregnancy test.  


Now the big fuck up. When you become a doctor, you agree to keep the secret about the patient. You also agree that you will do your best to save his life. If you don't do this, you are NOT WORTH to be a doctor. Her case is so private and other people are not supposed to know about this but she needs to explain herself in front of other 17 women which says it shames her so much. She even had to pay 200 pesos for this. I wish I am there and I would just go inside and take her out and scream at the doctor and also go to report the scam to the police as she did not receive any checkup from the doctor for the money she paid.  


Is there any place where this can be reported ?  


Another case similar to this is when her mother has a swollen arm and they go to the big city to be attended by a doctor, even they have money, there is no way that they get to any doctor.

For God's sake, what is happening to the doctors in the Philippines ? Where are they ? What are they ? Monsters ?  


Another bad story is when someone is sick and they are not admitted in the hospital unless they will prove having enough money, like 20000 php at least. He is left to die at the gate of the hospital and of course he died. SHAME ON YOU PIECES OF SHIT THAT YOU DO THAT. Even in Africa you will be admitted if you have an emergency.

When I was having Dengue I was presenting myself to a private hospital at the emergency room. Doctors are there but ignoring me for a long time and having no one to attend to. There is nothing that the local is supposed to solve. I can still walk and talk but I was being ignored. They all talk English there, no need for a local.
You do not get this thing about doctors. There are doctors in the hospitals but mostly ignoring the patients. There are doctors in emergency unit but they are ignoring the ones coming there.

My employee which is 19 and female had sex with her boyfriend and the condom broke. She came out to me for help. Me living in a normal country where people have choice (even abortion is legal, i do not agree with abortion unless specific cases), I advise her to visit the Ob-gyn doctor. She lives in a municipality 80 kilometers from a bigger city. She goes to the hospital in the municipality and the doctor is on leave and after 12 PM no doctor is available anymore. Next normal thing to do is to ask her to go to the bigger city, which is 2 hours travel. Of course, in a 250,000 inhabitants, no Ob-gyn doctor available in that specific moment and she has to return. Thinking of what is better, I ask her to try all the pharmacies to look for Plan B (emergency contraception) pills, but all the pharmacists did not even know what Plan B means, did not even understand the words 'emergency contraception', asking her what is that. After I search a little in Google I find out that there is no such thing in the Philippines and pharmacies are not allow to sell. I wonder though what kind of school those pharmacists attend, that they do not know what ""levonorgestrel"" means, because once you give this name, they are supposed to tell you what are the drugs available containing this substance. Maybe the school they attend is 'enjoy fiesta and eating lechon baboy' ?

They are giving attention to the people who need it more.

Let me explain it you.

Three patients come in, all from a vehicular accident.
A has a broken arm. B looks fine but has a big scratch on the arm. C is bleeding profusely.

They all come at the same time but the doctors will attend C first.

Plan B is absolutely NOT for regular use. It seriously messes up your hormones and can make you feel like *absolute shit* for a day or two. I believe long term effects of using Plan B regularly aren’t well-known either because it absolutely wasn’t meant for regular use.

To add, contraceptives that aren’t condoms also aren’t recommended as your main form of contraception if (1) you aren’t in a steady, monogamous relationship and (2) if you and/or your partner have had previous encounters and have not been tested for HIV/HPV recently. HIV is obviously serious and needs no explanation, but HPV is a bitch too. Genital warts definitely suck, but it’s worse for women as HPV is the main cause for cervical cancer. Please get yourself HPV vaccines *before* using non-condom contraception.

To sorta answer your question, I’d actually recommend IUDs over the other options. They’re the lowest maintenance and are very reliable. Once it’s inserted, you don’t have to think about it for 10 years except for your checkups which can be done yearly. Birth control pills, although they should be 99%++ effective, highly depend on the user.

Tbh in the long run ,the morning after pill, as effective as it was for me, it really just fucks up your whole menstruation period and not to mention the side effects are the worst. 

The first time I took it, I had fever and diarrhea for a whole week and I bled more than what I usually do when I’m on my period. After a while you get used to it and know what to expect but then again, it fucks up your menstruation cycle since it is supposed to make u bleed out. 

2 of my closest best friends have been on BCP. One has been taking it for a year and the other for 6 months, needless to say, what they say about mood swings is quite true. So if you are planning on going on it, warn your SO that you might get irritated easily along with other emotional side effects.

Some just cause genital warts. The virus becomes *dormant* in most people over time, but once you get it you can never truly *clear* it. Meaning it can recur and you can still pass it on when it does. Vaccines against the strain that you have aren’t effective anymore, but they will be against the ones you don’t have so it’s still a good idea to get vaccinated even if you’re already infected. But basically yeah, there’s no cure, only prevention.

Both luckily and unluckily, the strains that cause warts do not cause cervical cancer. They can remove the abnormal cells that may lead to cancer, there are also “treatments” that can remove warts, but again, they’re not 100% effective. They can recur and you’d have to go undergo the procedure again, which is expensive and painful.

There’s also some conflicting research about the effect of contraceptives on hpv and cancer. So really, it’s just best to invest in vaccines as early as possible.

Unfortunately, people love to fuck mindlessly like lab bunnies without thinking of the possible consequences. They think that it's all fun and games until pregnancy knocks on their doors. And when that moment comes, they'd rather have the baby flushed out of the woman's body than take some responsibility. A few years ago, a friend of mine borrowed some cash from me for a reason he couldn't say. When finally spilled it, he told me that he used the money to get his girlfriend an abortion, who was knocked up by her ex. When I was visiting them one time (my friend and I are neighbors), there was this one time that his girlfriend was bleeding all over the toilet, and she was deathly pale. It was a horrifying sight, but they insisted not to take her to the hospital. It took her months to bounce back and recover from what happened. No one should experience that.

Doctors are definitely part of the issue. I have been to two OB-GYNEs who were actually mad that I was on birth control. The first one scolded me because I was ""just 22"" and she said I had no business being on the pill. Two years later, I was getting an IUD check up and the OB-GYNE lost her mind.

Edit 2: GOLD?! Is talking about birth control and reproductive health my true purpose in life?!",CrocPB,"Specially to their nether regions *owwwww!*

Where did I hear about circumcision? Or the injections? The injections were for anaesthesia (which ironically hurts like a motherf*cker).

Yep, very prevalent and well....almost pointless. Asides from you know....when your doctor recommends it.

>but parents still make their male children go through it.
Tell me about it. Add to the fact that children at that age are expected to shut up and obey means that the individual grounds for the procedure are almost not even a consideration at all.

The kids are not even asked at any point whether they want the procedure and the doctor likely doesn't talk the kid through the procedure or what happens or why it's even a procedure

It doesn't help that macho man culture is still prevalent too: you'll have your manhood insulted if you refused to undergo it from your peers.

From my personal experience: I had no idea why or what the f*ck was going on. They brought me back from the UK to have the procedure done. No questions, no GP (UK doctor) appointments. Nothing. I was feeling a little scared and I wanted to ask if I had to do the operation but I was too intimidated to do so. Once in the PH it's not like I can run away and hide can I? So off to the clinic.....and let's just say I had never felt such pain in my life before or ever since (if you want me to talk about the details I can do that too). Then the healing procedure....throbbing pains and then the scars healed.

The only way I can come to terms with this is that I was browsing Wikipedia and came across the medical condition known as [""Phimosis""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phimosis). Which I thought I had and would want to speak to a GP about. I didn't get the chance because of the circumcision (which is *one* of the ways to address it).

If I find that I develop health problems as a result of this (i.e. scars never fully healed so sex would hurt) I don't know if I can forgive anyone that coerced me into it.

What I find to be absolutely infuriating however is one of the reasons why one would have it done: apart from *proper* health reasons with certification from a medical professional and cleanliness issues (seriously, is it that hard to clean it?), one of the oft quipped reasons to have it done is.......*so that you become taller*. Apparently. I overheard my aunt say that with regards to her son (as he is reaching circumcision age) and I hope to whoever he seeks independent advice. To justify such an invasive procedure on that ground (which I honestly doubt is true) makes me boil in anger. I mean never mind I'm fairly tall circumcision had nothing to do with it. Many Filipino men have it done and most of them are still midgets (no offense)

And if I have kids and any Filipino family or relations ask me if I'm having them circumcised I don't know if I can stop myself from exploding.

Sorry for the long wall of text....I just detest the idea of circumcision and think a discussion on health in the PH is sorely lacking beyond belief.",4,t1_cp96ooo,1,r/Philippines,8,3050,supporting

During the initial consultation the doctor acknowledged my reluctance and met my trepidation with the following statement (and I quote, word-for-word).

*If it makes you feel any better, I did my own vasectomy*

Doctor Feelgood continued by adding that he was an Army medic early in his career and he learned to perform nearly flawless vasectomies by practicing on soldiers during cross-Atlantic flights in cargo planes, turbulence and all.

cvirnpo,Ten Pinoy Legal Stuff You Probably Don't Know,"1. The law presumes potency, but if your wife is still a virgin after three years, the doctrine of triennial cohabitation kicks in and you're considered impotent. The burden of evidence that you're actually potent now shifts to you. (various Civil Law books, no case has ever used this doctrine yet)

2. Although spam is not exactly allowed by the Supreme Court, any interference in the receipt of spam is prohibited because it would rob the recipients of their right to receive messages. Lolwhat. (Disini v. Secretary of Justice)

2. Making sex videos, so long as there is consent on both sides, is not a crime in itself. (Disini v. Secretary of Justice)

3. Commenting, liking, and sharing libelous statements is not a crime, unless in so doing you also committed a separate libel. (Disini v. Secretary of Justice)

4. A husband cannot have vasectomy without the consent of his wife. (Imbong v. Ochoa)

5. Ferdinand Marcos (UP) got a grade of 98.8% in the Bar Exams, but was disputed and lowered down to 92.35%. Florenz Regalado (San Beda) now holds the highest grade with 96.7%. This has now been considered as almost impossible to beat.

6. The people share legislative power (the power to create, amend, or repeal laws) with the Congress. This power has never been exercised since its inception. (1987 Constitution)

7. Dolphins, toothed whales, porpoises and other cetacean animals of Tanon Strait has been granted legal standing by the Supreme Court to 'file' an environmental case against the oil exploration in their area. They won. (Resident Marine Mammals of Tanon Strait v. Reyes)

8. Fortune telling is a crime. (Art. 318, Revised Penal Code)

9. Dueling (not the Yu-Gi-Oh kind, but the gentlemen's fight one) is a crime. (Section Three, Chapter One, Title Eight, Revised Penal Code)

1) If you discovered your spouse in the act of making sexual intercourse with someone, you could hurt them physically and you would be absolved. If would kill any one of them, you wouldn't be imprisoned but would be banished from the site where you killed your spouse (aka destierro)- Art. 247. Death or physical injuries inflicted under exceptional circumstances. Revised Penal Code.

2) There is no frustrated theft/robbery. Either you attempted one or consummate it (finish the act). So for example you have take a box of tide from the market but before you could use it, the security guards in the mall catches you, you are liable for theft.

3) There is also no frustrated rape.Attempted or consummated lang.

4) There is an impossible crime.

5) If you change your sex through an operation, you can't ask the court to change your gender to male/female (Silverio vs Republic).

Hence, there should be seconds, agreement to a location, agreement to a weapon, etc.

If you wish to amend the Constitution, the Constitution itself says so - 12% of the total number of registered voters, of which every legislative district must be represented by at least 3% of the registered voters therein. This may not be done at present since there is yet no enabling law (the Supreme Court held in Santiago v. COMELEC that RA 6735 is not an enabling law for the amendment of the Constitution).

Reproductive Health Bill or HB96

YOU NEED TO KNOW

* In all Countries where abortion is now legal, a ""Reproductive health Bill"" was also first put in place.

* Let us not allow ourselves to be tricked. No to this Bill means No to the following .....


1) EMPLOYERS will be compelled to provide free reproductive health care services, supplies, devices and surgical procedures (including vasectomy and ligation) to employees. (Section17 states that the employers shall provide for free delivery of reproductive health care services, supplies and devices to all workers more particularly women workers. (Definition of Reproductive Health and Right Sections 4, paragraph g, Section 21, Paragraph c and Section 22 on Penalties).

This implies that an employer who fails to provide for free, say a condom, to his driver when requested, can be hauled to court for violating the provisions of the Bill. This absurd example can be extended to the office where the owner of the business can be liable for violations if he does not provide contraceptives to his female employees if such are requested. 

2) HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROVIDERS must provide reproductive health care services such as giving information on family planning methods and providing services like ligation and vasectomy regardless of the patient's civil status, gender, religion, or age/minors included. (Section 21 on Prohibited Acts, Letter a, Paragraphs 1 to 5 and Section 22 on Penalties)

3) A SPOUSE does not need the consent of the husband or wife to undergo a ligation or vasectomy.

The procedures of ligation or vasectomy are mandatorily made available to a spouse without partner consent. Such a provision is anti-Catholic since the procedures are clearly not allowed by the Catholic Church but will now be made accessible to whoever wants the procedure performed.

4) CHILDREN from age 10 to 17 will be taught their sexual rights and the means to have satisfying and ""safe"" sex life as part of their school curriculum. Parents will no longer have any control over the sex education of their children. (Section 12 on Reproductive Health Education and Section4 Definition of Family Planning and reproductive Health, Paragraph b, c, and d) Sex education becomes a mandatory part of a school curriculum. 

This means that the oversight over the sex education of their children by parents is diminished since it is the school that will formulate and implement the program, the content of which will be dictated by State policies. The Bill proposes to teach children how to achieve satisfying and safe sex in life which is distorted and unacceptable view of human sexuality. The problem is that any objection to the program can be considered as actions inimical to the Bill and therefore may be subject to penal sanctions for those who will oppose the content of such a sex education.

5) CITIZENS will be subjected to imprisonment and/or pay a fine, for expressing an opinion against any provision of this law, if such expression of opinion is interpreted as constituting ""malicious disinformation"" (Section 21 on Prohibited Acts Paragraph f and Section 22 on Penalties)

This dangerous provision threatens every Filipino who expresses anything against the law that is interpreted as ""malicious disinformation"" with imprisonment and/or fines. What is considered ""malicious"" has not been defined and therefore is open to a wide interpretation and will leave those who oppose the Bill very vulnerable. 

6) PARENTS will lose parental authority over a minor child who was raped and found pregnant (Section21, a, no.3).

This is an unconstitutional provision that removes parental control over minor children and hands it over to the State.

7) CONTRACEPTIVES will be classified as ""Essential medicines"" (Section 10). This means that the National Government will appropriate limited government funds to reproductive services instead of basic services (Section 23). As essential medicines, the government will fund the distribution of contraceptives in all public health centers and hospitals.

Scarce government resources will be spent to purchase such supplies for distribution in health centers and government hospitals. Our Congress clearly has a distorted view of national priorities which should put poverty alleviation by generating employment opportunities for the citizenry, economic development, environmental protection, and similar programs at the top of the national agenda rather than spending money for contraceptives, for medical procedures such as ligation and vasectomy.
