      "Hi! This will be a very lengthy post containing a brief overview on what this contraceptive method is, and then focusing on the procedure + post-insertion. I'm doing this because in the months I've researched about a contraceptive implant in the PH, I have come up with very little information (even on this sub!) and I want to give you guys an insight into another option. At the end of this post, I have a few links and a tl;dr!\n",
      "\n",
      "I will say this beforehand though: *If you have a deathly fear of injections, this might not be the method for you.*\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is a contraceptive implant?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**The contraceptive implant is a stick they insert in your arm**, between your skin and muscle, that prevents pregnancies **99.05% of the time** for both normal *and* perfect use. It's pretty hard to fuck something up when it's already inside your skin. That means less than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant in a year. The only way it fails is that if it breaks, you have sex following the 7 days after insertion, or you were already pregnant prior insertion. You have to replace this **every 3 years**. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some things about the implant:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It does not prevent against STDs. Use a condom for that.\n",
      "2. It does not act as an emergency contraceptive unlike IUDs. If you're pregnant, they won't put this in you.\n",
      "3. Yes, it has side-effects, as is with every hormonal contraceptive. Common ones are lighter to no periods at all, *LOTS* of periods, random spotting, acne, and weight gain. Make sure you've thoroughly researched the side-effects. What one person experienced may not be what you will experience. Your experience can be better or worse than others' because **each body is different and will react differently to the implant**.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also Google for more info.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Procedure**\n",
      "\n",
      "So I got my contraceptive implant, *Implanon* (an American brand), last June 27. I got it inserted in the Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Ofelia St., Brgy. Bahay Toro, Project 8, Quezon City. They have other branches as well; they have two in Tondo (Vitas, and Delpan), and others which I am not aware of. \n",
      "\n",
      "The contraceptive implant is **free**. Why is it free?, you ask. That's because Likhaan is an NGO that primarily focuses on women in marginalized communities. You can't exactly make poor people get contraceptives if they cost money. So yeah. From what I've read, OB-GYNEs usually charge 8-10k.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't particularly busy. There was just one person before me. The people there are nice and friendly; *super non-judgmental* especially since I'm a minor (17) and I don't exactly look marginalized. They didn't refuse me service and they even encouraged me to inform other people about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The procedure is quick, around 30 minutes maybe. I was led into a small clinic, asked to answer this form, and then I lied down on a bed. I was administered a shot of local anaesthesia onto the side of my arm. It was bleeding quite a bit and I had to put pressure on it while they were getting the Implanon. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Implanon was then inserted; it was like a stapler gun. I still did feel something but the anaesthesia hurt worse. I was then instructed to feel the implant; this is important because **if you can't feel it under your skin then there's something wrong and it has to be removed**. It might have been shot in deeper which would then render it ineffective.\n",
      "\n",
      "She then put a band-aid over the insertion site and put gauze then wrapped a bandage around my arm. You have to keep the bandage on for 24 hours, then the band-aid for 3 days. You can change the band-aid of course, just don't wet it and make sure it heals properly so it doesn't get infected. It will most likely bruise; mine looked pretty nasty and it hurt a fair bit but it goes away after a few days.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's pretty much it! I was told to take Mefenamic Acid if the pain gets too much. Never had to take any, though. \n",
      "\n",
      "**AFTERNOTES + LINKS**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The bruise could look pretty prominent on your arm. If you live with people who would not approve of this then I don't really know how to hide this from them. It's probably also important to note that you should consider wearing a cardigan or something lest you want others to think you're a domestic abuse victim.\n",
      "* [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/3WUAE) containing some pics of the bruise and a few other things if you'd like to see.\n",
      "* If this is your first time to get a contraceptive, I wouldn't recommend having an implant as the first method. Try Pills first, or something.\n",
      "* **If you want Likhaan's phone number, feel free to shoot me a PM!** The ones lying around on the Internet are mostly outdated, lol.\n",
      "* I would like to thank /r/BirthControl for info about the Implanon, mainly about experiences during and while on it! It's a pretty handy resource for all kinds of contraceptives.\n",
      "* PGH's Ortoll Primary Reproductive Health Care Center also has free Implanon, I think, but they've been out of stock for God knows how long. Won't hurt to call them to check though.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have more questions, send me a PM or comment below ♥\n",
      "\n",
      "**TL;DR:** The contraceptive implant is a stick thing in your arm that's 99.95% effective (as effective or even more than a tubal ligation or an IUD) which has to be replaced every 3 years and is reversible. The procedure was done in Likhaan Center for Women's Health in Proj. 8, QC and was really quick and non-invasive. \n",
      "\n",
      "**UPDATE 09/26/2018**: I will no longer answer questions about how to contact Likhaan and whether you can walk-in or not. They now have a Facebook Page called \"Likhaan Center for Women's Health Inc.\" which has the contact information for ALL of their branches on their PINNED post. Please understand that I keep on getting repetitive PMs about this so please make use of the accessible info from their FB page.\n",
      "\n",

      "No questions, just wanted to thank you for posting. The topic of birth control is an oft asked one here, yet meaningful answers do not reliably come about mainly because of a lack of information. You've just contributed a very actionable option.\n"
